## Static Comp Peer Review

### Eval Grading Rubric (20 minutes each)

For this project, you get to be in charge of the eval!  This is a great opportunity to review another person's code and assess something that isn't your own.  This is a common thing you'll do when working on your group projects and when you have a job.  Assessing code and seeing what works and what could potentially be improved on is beneficial for you and your peers!  Here's a rubric with some questions to think about as your partner presents their project and you assess.

Write out at least three or more points of feedback in each section.  

#### Design/Comp Recreation

* How close does their site match the comp?  Are there small details that are missing?
  - Pay attention to spacing, readability, sizing/positioning of elements
* Is your partner's site responsive?  Are elements logically spaced as the window gets smaller?

#### HTML Structure/Style

* Take a look through the style guide and check if your partner's code follows these rules.
* Are they using mostly semantic HTML? (staying away from nested divs, using correct elements, etc.)
* Is the HTML structure clean and steers clear from unnecessary nesting?

#### CSS Structure/Style

* Take a look through the style guide and check if your partner's code follows these rules.
* Are the styles organized in a logical way?  Are the properties for each rule organized alphabetically or by similar groups (widths and heights, margins and paddings, etc.)
* Do the class names clearly explain what elements they are meant to style?
* Are classes that share similar styles grouped together?  If multiple classes share similar styles, how could it be refactored into one class?
* Are there instances where your partner is using `!important`?
