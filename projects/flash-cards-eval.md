length: 1 week
tags: javascript, oop, mocha, testing

## Goals and Objectives

- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application 
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

# Evaluation Rubric

### Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 4 (at least one extension) with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 3 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.
* 2: Application is usable but has some missing functionality.
* 1: Application crashes during normal usage.

### Fundamental JavaScript & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Javascript syntax, style, and refactoring.
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution.

### Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient given project requirements.
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD.

### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear.
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.


## Review Guide

While reviewing the code, ask yourself the following questions:

*Functional Expectations*
- Does the code work? Does it perform its intended function, the logic is correct etc.
- Play through the app as is. Are there any bugs/crashes? When do these occur? What might this point to?

*Fundamental JavaScript & Style*
- Is all the code easily understood?
- Does it conform to [Turing's Style Guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript)? These will usually cover location of braces, variable and function names, line length, indentations, formatting, and comments. How many errors or warning show when the linter is run?  
- Is there any redundant or duplicate code?
- Is there any commented out code? Any console.logs?
- Do the names used in the application convey intent?

*Test-Driven Development*
- Do tests exist, and are they comprehensive? Is there a test for every method? For initial state for new instances?
- Do unit tests actually test that the code is performing the intended functionality?
- Is there evidence of refactoring in the testing suite?

*Encapsulation*
- Does the code follow the principle of single responsibility?
- Are there any areas where there are unintentional dependencies being created between objects?
