## Specification
The static comp challenge is a challenge to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle:  Once you get into the workforce, building out comps that reflect the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement. This project is meant to give you an at-bat with matching a comp as pixel perfect as you can.

## Creative License
You may NOT take any creative liberties with this design. You should act as though you have been handed this comp by a professional designer and it is your job to bring that design to life in exact detail. This includes details like the width and color of borders, the spacing between images, font size, etc. 

## Assets
- The images and icons are provided for you in the repo in the `images` directory
- You should match the colors by using a tool like [this color picker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?pli=1)
- You can use a tool like [this pixel ruler](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pixgrid-ruler/glkplndamjplebapgopdlbicglmfimic) to match sizing
- The font used in the comp is [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?preview.text=warm&stroke=Sans+Serif)

## Set Up + Submission
- Fork [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/dog-party/)
- Push your final work to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Below are instuctions for deploying to GH Pages:
  - Repo Settings » Pages » Select the main branch as your Source branch » Save. Then, wait up to an hour, hit refresh, and your deployed link should appear at the top of the screen.
  - If you don’t want to wait, your GH pages URL will follow this format: `https://username.github.io/dog-party/` and replace username with the repo owner’s GH username and dog-party with your repo’s name (if different). The URL will not work right away - that’s ok!
- Submit your repo and GH pages links [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kW1JPMpZUhAjzIDnW_wDrGB8PtRDTIFh9ohpkd5h0xk/edit) by the due date listed in your calendar

## Other Notes
- This page does not need to be responsive to screensize
- There does not need to be any JavaScript for this project. It will be a static page with no functionality.
