Throughout Mod 3 you'll be building an `Ideabox` over and over again. An `IdeaBox` is a very basic application which takes in some user information, and updates the DOM with that information! Wow!

## Learning Goals

* Gain competency with React fundamentals
* Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
* Practice refactoring
* Create a multi-page UX using Router

## Features
In order to get the practice with all of the fundamentals, a thorough ideabox might contain the following features:

- Functional components
- React hooks to manage and update state
- A controlled form or two that allows user to render elements to the page
- Routing
- Some network requests if possible
- Cypress tests for general user flows and network requests
