title: Balancing Act
---

## Overview

As a Front End Developer, you’re going to need to accurately build out the UI (User Interface) for websites based on comps provided by a designer. For your first project, you’ll re-create the Dashboard page of a small budgeting app to practice writing well structured, semantic HTML with clean, precise CSS, as well as take a first crack at adding some user interaction with JavaScript and the DOM.

Similar to what you might be asked to do on the job, we’ve given you the comps with a set of technical specifications to go along with it and your challenge is to build it.

**Note:** DO NOT use CSS Flexbox or Grid during Week 1 of this project (If you don’t know what this is, no worries! You’ll learn more about these features of CSS in the coming weeks.)

## Learning Goals

- accurately build a provided comp
- write well structured and semantic HTML (according to the [Turing Style Guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/html))
- craft clean and DRY CSS
- use JavaScript to interact with the DOM

## Set Up

In your terminal, use the necessary commands to create a directory called `balancing-act` with the following file structure:

```
balancing-act
  |_index.html
  |_styles.css
  |_main.js
  |_assets
    |_images/icons will be stored inside the assets directory
```

Find the provided icons [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tinxJcBu8lf5dHIJZtmOgXnzGu8yhKRK?usp=sharing). Download them into your assets directory for this project.

Lastly, create a repository on GitHub and connect to this local repository. If you aren't sure how to do that, follow the steps in [this tutorial](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-1/github-repo.html).
