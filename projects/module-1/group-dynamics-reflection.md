# Pair / Group Dynamics Reflection

Often times in interviews, you will be asked to provide a detailed description of a time you worked in a team. The strongest interviewers are able to provide a detailed account of the project and cite specific examples to highlight wins and/or struggles. At Turing, we want you to being crafting your portfolio of "experiences" so that you can have several examples you can speak to when you are interviewing.

Please create a private gist that highlights the prompts below. Take time to provide thoughtful and descriptive answers while the experience is still fresh in your mind so that you have a collection of reflections you can pull from when it is time to start interviewing!

## Abstract

- In a few sentences, explain **what** the project was and the scope of your work. Imagine explaining your answer to a technical recruiter or a developer who you'd potentially be interviewing with who knows nothing about Turing.

## Overall (Choose One)

- What role do you typically play on a team? (If you answer, provide an example from this project)
- What is your approach to working on a team? (In your answer, provide an example from this project)
- Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a colleague and how you resolved it. (only choose if applicable to this project)

## Technical (Choose One)

- What was a specific technical challenge your group faced? How did you approach this challenge? What went well? What was a struggle?
- What resources or strategies did you use when you were presented with a technical challenge?
- You can’t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?

## Reflection

- What is one personal/professional takeaway from this project?
- What is one technical takeaway from this project?
- Based on these takeaways, what is something you want to focus on for the next project?
