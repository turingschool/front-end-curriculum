### Set Up 

- Follow the instructions in the README to clone down [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/task-tracker)

### Part 1 - Scavenger Hunt

First, run `git checkout scavenger-hunt` to get to the correct branch

Take notes in your notebook as you find the following.
- What represents the data model? 
- Find two examples of the data model being updated.
- Find one example of a DOM update that relies on the data model.
- Find two functions that have at least one parameter. Add a console log to each function to see what the value of that parameter is when the function is invoked.
- Find an example of a pure function.
- Find an example of a function's returned value being used somewhere else.
- Find an example of event delegation. Why is event delegration neccessary in that example?
- Find an example of bracket notation being used to access an object. Why is bracket notation used? Notice how the data is structured to allow for this.

### Part 2 - Bug Fix

First, run `git checkout bug-fix` to get to the correct branch. If you made changes to the code on the `scavenger-hunt` branch, you may need to commit your work before switching branches (`git add .`, `git commit...`) - don't push!

Oh no! There are a few bugs you need to fix:
- Every new event is posting to Monday ðŸ˜± 
- Duplicate events are posting whenever a new event is created ðŸ˜©
- //something about a "no events" message
