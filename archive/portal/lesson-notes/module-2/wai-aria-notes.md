## Notes from Nov 30, 2016 session

Okay - I've got good news and (maybe) bad news

We're going to start this lesson with watching a 35 minute conference talk. Lights dim, all that jazz.

The good news is, it's a super good conference talk AND we have bagels. My logic is, it's too early for popcorn - but we need something to munch on if we're going to watch the TV.

Things to keep in mind as you watch this talk:

- How will you test out the accessability of your websites?
- 'Perfect is the Enemy of Good'
  - What does that mean in this context - and in others at Turing?
- Components, refactoring and keeping code DRY - how does that fit in to managing accessibility.

The last thing I want to say, I have ADD and for me, if it's a bad day, I literally can't sit through a 30 minute video without speeding it up and taking breaks every 10 minutes.

I'm going to give ya'll about 5 minutes to go snag some bagels, if you have _any_ reason that you'd prefer to watch this conference talk on your own, grab the bagel and excuse yourself.

The talk will be 40 minutes with a pomodoro so I ask that you be back by 11am to continue the lesson, but otherwise feel free to consume the talk however you prefer.

Bagels, give five minutes to go snag them.

What we're talking about today are ARIA roles and I want to preface this lesson by saying that I am learning about this along with you.
