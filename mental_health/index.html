      Your mental health is important! We know Turing is stressful. Here are
      several resources that are available to you!
    </p>

    <h3>Your instructors</h3>
    <p>
      If you feel comfortable reaching out to your instructors, we're always
      happy to listen, and we can refer you to other staff members who can
      assist you if you need further help than we can give. We also recommend joining the slack channel #health-wellness for
      community wellness tips, reminders,
      and events.
    </p>

    <h3>Financial stress</h3>
    <p>
      For financial concerns, you can reach out directly to Tamika Shipp on
      Slack; he can connect you with various services (especially in the
      Colorado area), or help you find services in your area, to help alleviate
      financial stressors.
