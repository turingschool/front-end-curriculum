      Your mental health is important! We know Turing is stressful. Here are
      several resources that are available to you!
    </p>

    <h3>Mental health resources</h3>

    <p>It can also be helpful to find a community! Turing has many <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z6KoqTbLQcudqybCvaHaivf0YNM73BjTNZWPOBuWDcU/edit">Student Circles</a>, which are slack channels for people (students, staff, and alumni) who share identities or interests! Examples are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Queer Qoders - for LGBTQ+ students, staff, and alumni</li>
      <li>Black @ Turing - for Black students, staff, and alumni</li>
      <li>Mezcla - for Latinx and Hispanic students, staff, and alumni</li>
      <li>ADHD Brains - for students, staff, and alumni who have ADHD</li>
      <li>and many more!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can find information about many more Circles in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z6KoqTbLQcudqybCvaHaivf0YNM73BjTNZWPOBuWDcU/edit">this document</a>!</p>

    <h3>Financial stress</h3>
    <p>
      For financial concerns, you can reach out directly to Tamika Shipp on
      Slack; she can connect you with various services (especially in the
      Colorado area), or help you find services in your area, to help alleviate
      financial stressors.
