### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will:

* Understand what continuous integration is and why it's important
* Be familiar with a typical deployment flow for agile teams
* Be able to implement TravisCI for continuous integration and automatic deployments

## What is Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration is a jargony buzzword that means "releasing changes fast and often". The goal of CI is to ensure stability by releasing smaller changesets at a time that are each fully tested. Many projects these days will rely on some sort of automated service to handle testing these changesets and facilitating frequent releases.

Some of the most common CI services you'll hear about are [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and Jenkins. They all behave in a similar manner, though the setup and configuration process for each tool is slightly different. Today we'll focus on integrating TravisCI to perform a full build of an application, test it using our test suite, and once that is finished, automatically deploy our changes to Heroku.

## Why Use a CI Tool?
Being able to run and test a full build of your application before you release it to production is important. Think of how easy it was to deploy new changes to your production apps on Heroku. You would make a commit, and it would immediately be reflected on production after running `git push heroku master`. What if that commit introduced breaking changes? There is no safeguard or filter against pushing up bad code. With a CI tool like TravisCI, we can still take advantage of automatic deployments, but we also get an extra layer of assurance that our app is in good condition before any changes are pushed live.

TravisCI will also help you catch errors that you might not find locally. By more closely mimicking a production environment, we can recognize any differences that might be causing inconsistent behavior between environments. For example, if I am developing an app locally and I did an `npm install` months ago, and I did not explicitly lock down the version numbers for each of my dependencies in my `package.json`, I might not notice that my production environment received more updated packages during the `npm install` phase. Some of these packages may have included breaking changes that would only be exposed in production, and impossible to reproduce locally until another `npm install` was run.

## Getting Started with TravisCI

1. Sign up for a TravisCI account [here](https://travis-ci.org/) and login with your GitHub account (the **`.org`** version of TravisCI is FREE, the `.com` version of TravisCI is NOT free).

2. Authorize TravisCI to access information about your GitHub repos (it's ok)

3. Click the `+` button next to "My Repositories" on the left pane

4. Search for the name of the repository using the `Filter repositories` box (you might have to click the `Sync account` button on the top right)

5. Flip the switch!

6. Go back to your TravisCI dashboard (Click on the `Travis CI` icon on the top left of the page)

That's it! Easy, right? Just kidding.

Now, any time you push new commits to your remote repository, TravisCI will automatically kick off a new build so you can keep an eye on the overall health and stability of your application.

_Note: If you don't see your repo after you've flipped the switch, try refreshing the page._

### Configuring TravisCI

As you may have noticed, front-end repos are made up of 90% config files and 10% actual code. In order for TravisCI to be able to run our code and run our tests, we need to add a `.travis.yml` file to the root of our repository. Any time TravisCI runs a build, it will look for this file and follow any instructions we provide.

## What is a Build?

Think of all the steps you have to take if you want to collaborate on a classmate's project. You have to fork their repo, clone it down locally, make sure you have an up-to-date version of Node (or some other platform) on your machine, install any dependencies, start up a server and maybe run a file watcher. Sometimes more complex projects require additional steps. This setup process is called a "build". It's all the things you need to do to get your app up and running. CI tools will run through all of these steps (and then some!) to make sure the application is in a stable, working state before it goes to production.

Add a `.travis.yml` file to the root of your project. Yes, there is a dot in front of the filename because it is a hidden file, which are typically used for configuration files.

## Phases of the Build Process

The yml file can define settings for various phases of the build lifecycle. In TravisCI, there are two main phases of the [build lifecycle](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#The-Build-Lifecycle), three if you add on automatic deployment:

* **install:** install any dependencies required (configure the virtual machine (VM) to be able to run your code)
* **script:** run the build script (run your code and tests)
* **deploy:** deploy your code to your web servers

### Test

Before we get started configuring the TravisCI installation, script, and deployment phases, let's make sure we have our test script set up.

By default, in our Node projects the TravisCI test section will simply try to run `npm test`. If you don't currently have a command in here for your test script in your `package.json` file, update it to reflect the command you've been using to run your tests. That might look something like this:

```js
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "test" : "jest --forceExit",
  "test:watch": "jest --watchAll"
}
```

**Run `npm test` to make sure your tests are passing locally.** If they are, you're ready to move on to the next steps. If not, then fix or skip the tests temporarily to get a passing test suite.

## Begin TravisCI Configuration

You take it from here. Let's push up our `.travis.yml` file to the master branch on GitHub, look at the TravisCI build, and squash those errors!

## Checking Pull Requests

After we have configured pushes to our master branch to successfully build, what about checking pull requests before they are merged?

## Badges

What about those cool badges you see in GitHub repositories that show if the latest build has passed all of the tests in TravisCI? How do we add this?

<!-- ### Machine

Let's create our circle.yml file and set some configuration options for our virtual machine. At the very least, you should pin down a timezone and the version of node you're running:

```js
machine:
  timezone:
    America/Denver
  node:
    version: 7.10.0
```

Without changing our `package.json`, we could also override CircleCI's default test section (or any section for that matter) with:

```js
test:
  override:
    - ./node_modules/.bin/mocha
```

This is useful for changing the commands you want to run during the test phase and adding additional ones. (e.g. if we had an eslint configuration in our project, we might also want to make sure our linter is passing in the test section as well.)

### Database

Finally, we need to set up and configure a database specifically for our CircleCI builds. We can think of CircleCI as another environment, similar to how we have a development, test, and production environment. While we don't need to create an entire new environment to run these builds, we do need to do some additional setup to work with a database.

CircleCI includes a lot of popular services by default - postgres being one of them. They actually already have a postgres connection set up that we can hook into so we don't have to create our own. We can access this by setting an environment variable called `DATABASE_URL`. This might be familiar from when we installed the postgres addon to our production applications in Heroku and grabbed that variable for our production connection.

The CircleCI postgres connection is: `postgresql://ubuntu:@127.0.0.1:5432/circle_test`

We can set this as an environment variable in our `circle.yml` file under the `machine` section, in a subsection called `environment`:

```js
machine:
  timezone:
    America/Denver
  node:
    version: 7.10.0

  environment:
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql://ubuntu:@127.0.0.1:5432/circle_test
```

*Note: be careful of your indentations and syntax. If there is an error in your `circle.yml` file, or something isn't nested properly, you will not be able to kick off a new build.*

Now we need to update our `knexfile` to use this `DATABASE_URL` in our test environment:

```js
  test: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'postgres://localhost/jetfueltest',
    useNullAsDefault: true,
    migrations: {
      directory: './db/migrations'
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: './db/test/seeds'
    }
  }
```

Commit these changes and run a new build. You should see all of your tests running properly connected to a database.


## Automatic Deployments
CircleCI provides deployment integration with other popular services such as Heroku. Upon a successful build, we can configure CircleCI to deploy our changes. This takes a bit more work, but the seamless automation makes it all worthwhile. 

In order to have CircleCI take control over our deployments, we need to configure Heroku’s default ‘automatic deployments’. In Heroku, go to your application's deployment settings and select ‘Configure Automatic Deploys…’.

![Wait for CI][wait-for-ci]

### CircleCI - Add Deploy User
In your project settings in CircleCI, you'll see an option for 'Heroku Deployments' under the 'Continuous Integration' label. Click on that and add yourself as the deploy user. You'll need to add your Heroku API key which you can find on your [Account Settings Page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account) in Heroku. Once your API key is in place, you should be able to automatically add yourself as the deploy user.

### Circle.yml - Configuring Deployments
The final step to linking up automatic deployments is adding an extra configuration phase to the `circle.yml` file in your repo. To set up deployments, you'll need to specify a branch and a heroku appname like so:

```yml
deployment:
  production:
    branch: master
    heroku:
      appname: your-production-app-name
```

Now whenever we push to our master branch, CircleCI will automatically run a build for us and deploy only if and when the build succeeds.

## Adding Status Badges
You'll often see build status icons on the README files of popular open source libraries and frameworks. This is a quick and easy way to reassure users that the code is reliable. CircleCI provides a markdown snippet that we can paste directly into our README. In CircleCI, under your project settings, you'll see a 'Status Badges' link under the 'Notifications' heading in the sidebar. Copy and paste the markdown snippet provided for you and add it to your project's README.
