<h2 id="welcome_to_the_front_end_engineering_program">Welcome to the Front-End Engineering Program.</h2>

</section>
<section>

<p>We&#8217;re going to talk a little bit about how to be <em>successful</em> at Turing.</p>

</section>
<section>

<h1 id="traditional_school">Traditional School</h1>

<ul>
<li>Memorize some facts</li>
<li>Take some tests</li>
<li>Quietly listen to someone ~~drone on~~ teach</li>
<li>Figure out the one right answer or way to do something</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="educational_approach">Educational Approach</h3>

<ul>
<li>You learn by doing</li>
<li>Gradual release of responsibility</li>
<li>Spiraling of expertise</li>
<li>Community-driven education</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>

<ul>
<li>6 weeks.</li>
<li>Each is pass/fail.</li>
<li>Build up a portfolio.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>

<ul>
<li>Module 1 and Module 2 are highly structured.</li>
<li>Module 3: more independence.</li>
<li>Module 4: very independent.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<p>It&#8217;s that whole &#8220;gradual release of responsibility.&#8221;</p>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="weeks">Weeks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Monday &amp; Tuesday are more instructional.</li>
<li>Wednesday &amp; Thursday have more work and evaluation/feedback time.</li>
<li>Friday is community day.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Typical class is 90-minutes with one instructor focused on one topic.</li>
<li>Classes are supposed to be &#8220;just in time&#8221; to apply the skill to your project.</li>
<li>Classes may be lecture, code-along, tutorial, small group work, etc.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

<ul>
<li>Projects are where you cement your learning</li>
<li>Typically 1-2 weeks long</li>
<li>Evaluated by an instructor</li>
<li>Building blocks of your portfolio</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<h2>This is going to be a little different.</h2>

</section>
<section>

<p>Yes, some basic skills (e.g. syntax) should be memorized.</p>

<p>But, you can <em>always</em> reference the documentation.</p>

</section>
<section>

<ul>
<li>There are multiple ways to complete a task.</li>
<li>There is rarely <em>one</em> right answer.</li>
<li>You learn by doing the thing.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<p>Sorry—but, we&#8217;re <em>not</em> sorry.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>The goal here is to not waste your time.</p>

<p>Some people ask how is it possible to learn to do all of this stuff in like 7 months? Because it&#8217;s super concentrated.</p>

<section>

<p>Do we believe everyone can do it? No.</p>
<p>We have an admissions process. We&#8217;ve been refining it for two years. You got in.</p>

</section>

</section>
<section>

<p>Everyone struggled.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>Everyone <em>still</em> struggles.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>Why not just go to the instructor and get the answer instead of struggling for a bit?</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>(Something about giving people fish and teaching them to fish, I suppose.)</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>As instructors, we don&#8217;t necessarily have the answers.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>Each situation is unique.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>There might be multiple answers to one question.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>Hey, there might even been multiple questions to one answer.</p>

</section>

<p>(I don&#8217;t really know what that means, but it felt smart when I wrote it.)</p>
