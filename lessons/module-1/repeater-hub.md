title: Mod 1 Repeater Hub
---

Welcome! Please read this entire page completely. Reach out to your instructors if you have any questions!

## Slack Channels
Make sure you are part of the following channels:
* **#mod1_repeater_fam**: The main channel for mod1 repeaters. Instructors will post announcements here so it's important to check this channel daily.
* **#the_repeaters**: A community of Turing students and alumni who have repeated or are currently repeating a module.

## Goal Tracking
Add your name to [this Goals Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bQ9zZbW0mxLfMXDLQZT4W2M5Z-nv_6FZ1T5WC8Io8Zo/edit#gid=1626636507) and fill out your goal for Intermission. We will check in on these goals on the Monday of Week 1.  

You will continue to add your weekly goals to that document every Monday throughout the inning. We'll set up a slackbot in #mod1_repeater_fam to remind you!

## Gear Ups and Professional Development  
**PD expectations for repeating Mod 1:**  
You will be added to a new Homeroom group and are expected to attend Homeroom discussions and Mix It Up on Wednesdays.  You are not required to attend the other PD sessions.  
Repeating the module is a great opportunity not only to solidify your technical skills but also your professional development skills. [This plan](https://careerdev.turing.edu/module_one/m1_PD_repeat_plan) goes over some suggested ways to approach that. Emma Byers is always available for support and coaching at the link in her Slack bio. You can reach out to her with any questions you have.  

**Gear Up expectations for repeating mod 1:**  
You are expected to attend all Gear Up sessions, except for Week 1 which is optional for repeaters.   

## Alternative Learning Opportunities
We want you to feel empowered to skip some classes if you feel like there is a better way to spend your time. **You can choose to miss up to 3 classes from the first few weeks of the inning:**  
* JS: Data Types
* JS: Object Literals
* JS: Bracket & Dot Notation
* JS: Functions
* JS: For Loops
* JS: Intro to Unit Testing
* JS: Intro to the DOM
* JS: Event Listeners
* JS: Classes
* JS: Unit Testing Classes
* Dev Skills: Git Workflow
* HTML Fundamentals
* CSS Fundamentals

If you decide to skip a lesson...
* You should always read through the lesson on your own. If you can complete all of the activities in the lesson without help, you should feel confident skipping that lesson. We recommend doing this no later than the day before the lesson is scheduled. That way, if you realize that you need to attend the class, it's not too late!  
* You should be spending this time productively. It's not to your benefit to use this time as "off" time. You can use this time to pre-teach an upcoming lesson, review or update your notes, or work on anything in the [Extra Practice page](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-1/extra-practice.html).
* DM all instructors prior to the start of class to let us know. If you do not tell us ahead of time, you will be marked absent.


## FAQs

**Q:** *Should I delete my mythical creatures repo and start over?*  
**A:** Yes! You should delete your old javascript-foundations repo and then clone down a new one and start over. It's important that you approach these problems with a clean slate. Plus, we may have updated the repo since last inning.  

**Q:** *Should I complete mythical creatures over and over?*  
**A:** No! You should only complete each mythical creature **once** this inning. After you complete all of the creatures, start working through the other test suites in that repo. We find that when students complete the same test suite more than 2 times, memorization and pattern matching kick in (which is not what we want!). These test suites should be improving your problem solving skills. If you feel yourself being able to write code without reading the full test, it's probably time for a new test suite.  

**Q:** *Should I reference my old projects when working on projects this inning?*  
**A:** This is not a good idea. Remember, the projects are about learning, not completion. We'd rather you productively struggle through the logic on a project than just look back at how you did it last time and copy the answer. Also, this approach isn't fair to your project partner(s) who is seeing this stuff for the first time. We know it's tempting, but remember **it's about process over product**.  

**Q:** *Should I get a head start on projects?*  
**A:** You should not be working on projects before they are officially kicked off. There is plenty for you to work on if you finish a project early (hint: the **Extra Practice** section!). Projects are meant to be completed in the time allotted. Also, instructors make changes to project specs leading up to the kickoff. Finally, one goal of group/paired projects is collaborative learning and communication and that is sacrificed when students work ahead on these projects.
