title: Mod 1 Repeater Hub

Welcome! Please read this entire page completely. Reach out to your instructors if you have any questions!

## Slack Channels
Make sure you are part of the following channels:
* **#mod1_repeater_fam**: The main channel for mod1 repeaters. Instructors will post announcements here so it's important to check this channel daily.
* **#the_repeaters**: A community of Turing students and alumni who have repeated or are currently repeating a module.

## Goal Tracking
Add your name to [this Goals Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bQ9zZbW0mxLfMXDLQZT4W2M5Z-nv_6FZ1T5WC8Io8Zo/edit#gid=1626636507) and fill out your goal for Intermission. We will check in on these goals on the Monday of Week 1.  

You will continue to add your weekly goals to that document every Monday throughout the inning.

## Professional Development  
Repeating the module is a great opportunity to solidify your technical AND professional development skills. As a repeater, you are not expected to re-do any of the async lessons or exit tickets. However, you are still expected to attend live (on Zoom) PD lessons!

<!-- **Gear Up expectations for repeating mod 1:**  
You are expected to attend all Gear Up sessions, except for Week 1 which is optional for repeaters.    -->

## Alternative Learning Opportunities
We want you to feel empowered to skip some classes if you feel you'd be better served by focusing on another technial concept or part of the curriculum. We trust you to know your needs, but **communication is key!** DM all instructors prior to the start of class to let us know you'll be skipping the lesson and how you'll be spending that time.

The following lessons are not optional. Repeaters must attend:
* Meet Your Cohort
* Cohort & Project Norm Setting
* Any live (on Zoom) PD lessons

If you decide to skip a lesson...
* You should always read through the lesson on your own. If you can complete all of the activities in the lesson without help, you should feel confident skipping that lesson. We recommend doing this no later than the day before the lesson is scheduled. That way, if you realize that you need to attend the class, it's not too late!  
* You should be spending this time productively. It's not to your benefit to use this time as "off" time. You can use this time to pre-teach an upcoming lesson, review or update your notes, or work on anything in the [Extra Practice page](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-1/extra-practice.html).

## Extra Mock Assessments
We want to support you in overcoming the final assessment, so we've added a few more mock assessments to give you some 1:1 technical feedback from an instructor. You can expect the following sessions to help you prepare:
- 1 Repeater Only Mock Assessment in Week 3
- The regular Mid-Module Mock Assessment
- 1 Repeater Only Mock Assessment in Week 4

## FAQs

**Q:** *Should I delete my javascript-foundations repo and start over?*  
**A:** Yes! You should delete your old javascript-foundations repo and then clone down a new one and start over. It's important that you approach these problems with a clean slate. Plus, we may have updated the repo since last inning.  

**Q:** *Should I complete javascript-foundations over and over?*  
**A:** No! You should only complete each test suite **once** this inning. We find that when students complete the same test suite more than 2 times, memorization and pattern matching kick in (which is not what we want!). These test suites should be improving your problem solving skills. If you feel yourself being able to write code without reading the full test, it's probably time for a new test suite.  

**Q:** *Should I reference my old projects when working on projects this inning?*  
**A:** No. Remember, the projects are about learning, not completion. We'd rather you productively struggle through the logic on a project than just look back at how you did it last time and copy the answer. Also, this approach isn't fair to your project partner(s) who is seeing this stuff for the first time. We know it's tempting, but remember **it's about process over product**.  

**Q:** *Should I get a head start on projects?*  
**A:** You should not be working on projects before they are officially kicked off. There is plenty for you to work on if you finish a project early (hint: the **Extra Practice** section!). Projects are meant to be completed in the time allotted. Also, instructors make changes to project specs leading up to the kickoff. Finally, one goal of group/paired projects is collaborative learning and communication and that is sacrificed when students work ahead on these projects.
