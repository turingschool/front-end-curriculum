## Overview & Docs

Let's review our three building blocks for front end development:

* __STRUCTURE__:  HyperText Markup Language (HTML) defines the structure and semantics of web pages on the web.
* __PRESENTATION__:  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) sets the look and style of a web page. CSS provides style to the structure provided by HTML.
* __BEHAVIOR__:  JavaScript allows us to define interaction in our pages. What happens when a user clicks on a certain area?

Turns out, CSS has some "behaviour tricks" up its sleeve as well. Through CSS transitions, transformations, and animations you can create quite a bit of movement on your page sans any real JavaScript. Stunning examples include:

### Definitions:

* CSS Transitions: CSS transitions allow property changes in CSS values to occur smoothly over a specified duration of time.
* CSS Transformations: By modifying the coordinate space, CSS transforms change the shape and position of the affected content without disrupting the normal document flow.
* CSS Animations: For more involved movement, we can use CSS animations rather than transitions and transformations. What's the difference? A transition is typically a state change that goes from A to B (like a :hover state), while an animation may have many stages from A to B to C to D.

# Practice

### Code Pen #1

Setup a div with the following styles:

```css
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 30px;
  height: 300px;
  width: 300px;
  margin: 0 auto;
```

1. Create a pseudo class of `hover`. On hover, the div should transition background color on a 2s delay. (Hint: `transition-property` & `transition-duration` are things)
2. What happens with the transition when you move your cursor off the div?
3. Move the transition properties out of the hover state and onto the base div. What is different now when you move your cursor off the block?
4. You can chain properties together that you want to transition. Change the background-color and border-radius at the same time, but set them to different duration speeds. The border of the box should transition from 30px to 0.
5. Assuming you have successfully completed steps 1-4, now delete the `transition-property` line of code. Does your animation still work? Why?

### Code Pen #2

Setup:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  border: 1px solid grey;
  height: 400px;
  width: 90%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 15px;
}

.box {
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 30px;
  height: 300px;
  width: 25%;
}
```
1. Create a hover state for the CONTAINER whereby the background color of the BOX changes to green.
2. Make the box move on hover by adding `margin-left: 75%`.
3. It's a stark transition. Smooth it out with a 1s transition that works when the user moves their cursor onto the container, and also works when they move their cursor off of the container.
4. Experiment with the following three values with the
   `transition-timing-function` on the container:
   * `transition-timing-function: ease;`
   * `transition-timing-function: steps(4, end);`
   * `transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(1, -1, 1, .5);`
5. Discuss your observations from #4 and research the documentation to prove and clarify your observations.

### Code Pen #3
Make 4 divs inside a wrapping element. When the wrapping element is hovered on, apply different transitions to all 4 internal divs using transition-delay so the transitions execute at different times. Make them move, change colors, change borders, go nuts. Use this block of code as a starting point:

```css
div .a { transition-delay: 0s; }
div .b { transition-delay: 1s; }
div .c { transition-delay: 2s; }
div .d { transition-delay: 3s; }
```

### Code Pen #4
Setup:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  border: 1px solid grey;
  height: 400px;
  width: 90%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 15px;
}

.box {
  background-color: yellow;
  border-top: 5px solid red;
  height: 95px;
  width: 100px;
  -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg);
}
```

1. Rotate the box counter-clockwise 45 degrees
2. What happens when you pass rotate an argument of `.5turn` or `.75turn` or `2turn`
3. You can control the origin from which the transformation initiates. Add `-webkit-transform-origin: 100% 100%;` to the hover state of your container and then experiment with changing the x and y values of the property. What do you notice by using 0 for both x and y, versus using 50% for both x and y?
4. Implement `scale` and `skew` transformations

### Code Pen #5

Setup:

```html
<div></div>
```

```css
div {
  background: yellow;
  height: 200px;
  width: 200px;
  margin: 100px auto 0;
}

@keyframes testAnimation {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
    border-radius: 50% 0 50% 0;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: aqua;
    border-radius: 0 50% 0 50%;
  }
}
```

1. Discuss with your partner what the testAnimation will do
2. Connect the defined keyframes to the div
3. Create a 3s duration for the animation
4. Create a zero animation delay
5. Create an infinite iteration count
6. Create a linear timing function
7. Set the animation direction to alternate

### Code Pen #6 :facepunch: :dizzy_face:
Experiment with all you've just learned and make a 4-stage animation(s). Hint: CodePen #5 was a 2-stage animation. Post animations in cohort slack channel.
