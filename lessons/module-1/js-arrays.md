## Learning Goals

* Review what you know about arrays
* Add and change values to arrays via their indices  
* Access nested data (arrays and objects)

## Vocabulary

- `Literal`  A way of declaring a data structure and its values at the same time
- `Array` Used to store a collection of data items/multiple values under a single variable name
- `Element` A single item stored in an array. An element can be of any data type.
- `Bracket Notation` How we access individual elements of an array. Either to
  express the element, or assign a new element.

## Part 1: Student Exploration

We will not get on a zoom call until about halfway through this lesson. We want to give YOU a chance to dig into the code and explore before we all get together and talk abotu arrays. It's okay (and expected!) that some of this activity will be difficult on your own. We want you to get used to that feeling - not knowing all the answers - and start to enjoy the process of diving in and getting your hands dirty in the code!

Spend **one hour** working through [this repl](https://replit.com/@kaylaewood/arrays-1#index.js). As you're working, write down the following things in your notes:
* Ah-ha moments/Key Points (for example: `The index of the first element of the array is 0, not 1.`)
* Questions (for example: `When would you want to have an array of nested arrays?`)

If you get stuck...
* Reference [this Intro to Arrays lesson](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-1/js-intro-to-arrays.html)
* Reference [javascript arrays documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
* Google (for example: `reassign element in array javascript`)
* Write down your question/what exactly you're stuck on and move on. Then ask that question when we get on the zoom call!

After this hour, we will get on the zoom call in your calendar and continue with the remainder of this lesson.
