<section>

<p>We&#8217;re going to talk a little bit about how to be <em>successful</em> at Turing.</p>

<h1 id="traditional_school">Traditional School</h1>

<ul>
<li>Memorize some facts</li>
<li>Take some tests</li>
<li>Quietly listen to someone ~~drone on~~ teach</li>

<li>Classes may be lecture, code-along, tutorial, small group work, etc.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

<li>Projects are where you cement your learning</li>
<li>Typically 1-2 weeks long</li>

<h2>This is going to be a little different.</h2>

</section>
<section>

<p>Yes, some basic skills (e.g. syntax) should be memorized.</p>

<p>But, you can <em>always</em> reference the documentation.</p>

</section>
<section>

<ul>
<li>There are multiple ways to complete a task.</li>
<li>There is rarely <em>one</em> right answer.</li>
<li>You learn by doing the thing.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<p>Sorry—but, we&#8217;re <em>not</em> sorry.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>The goal here is to not waste your time.</p>

<p>Some people ask how is it possible to learn to do all of this stuff in like 7 months? Because it&#8217;s super concentrated.</p>

<p>Do we believe everyone can do it? No.</p>
<p>We have an admissions process. We&#8217;ve been refining it for two years. You got in.</p>

<p>(Something about giving people fish and teaching them to fish, I suppose.)</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>As instructors, we don&#8217;t necessarily have the answers.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>Each situation is unique.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>There might be multiple answers to one question.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>Hey, there might even been multiple questions to one answer.</p>

</section>

<p>(I don&#8217;t really know what that means, but it felt smart when I wrote it.)</p>
