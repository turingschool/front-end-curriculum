### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will:

* Have the skills and vocabulary to talk through your approach and thinking for a project layout
* Begin to feel comfortable iterating on ideas quickly
* Have a plan and roadmap for your personal site


### Why Wireframe?

Before starting to write code for any new project, it's important to know why you are building it and what the expectations are for the finished product. Taking the time to sketch out your ideas is useful for many reasons, and it allows you to refine your assumptions about your product and get input from others to confirm that your approach makes sense. Iterating on ideas quickly is an important component of Agile development practices and it can save you precious time later on by identifying potential issues or misconceptions early on when the cost of making a change is significantly lower. It also helps get you in the habit of speaking clearly about your ideas and work. Getting used to working this way sooner than later is going to help you in the long run.


#### What are Wireframes?

Your first project will be to build a custom personal site to showcase the work you create over the next seven months. However, before diving into the code you need to know where you're heading with your project. What content will you have and how will you organize it? How many pages are you going to need? What do you want visitors to your site to read first?

To help answer these questions, we build wireframes of our site. Wireframes are like an architectural blueprint of your site -- they help us refine content and hierarchy without the distractions of color palettes, fonts, and imagery. They are a tool that allows us to refine our design strategy with minimal risk. If we realize something doesn't make sense in a wireframe, it's very quick and simple to change it. If we realize something doesn't make sense once we're elbows deep in a code base, it's going to set us back a lot more time.

Wireframes allow us to quickly get ideas out of our heads and in front of peers or users. They help us gather feedback and organize our thoughts. Our primary goal is to lock in our content and how it's structured on the page, taking into consideration how we want our page to flow, what our visitor's needs are, and what the correct hierarchy is for our content.

There are different "phases" of wireframes: user flow, low fidelity, mid fidelity, and high fidelity.

##### User Flow Wireframes

This is a simple visualization of how a user moves through your site. They can be quick, loose sketches or tighter digital renderings, but the idea is to think through and lock in the ways a user navigates to all the different areas and pages of your site.

##### Low Fidelity Wireframes

This is where you get all your ideas onto a page. Pen and paper is ideal for low fi wireframes, because it lets you move quickly without worrying about making things perfect. You'll focus 100% on the structure of your content, so don't get bogged down with details like fonts and colors. Feeling like you're to focused on the little things? Try using a thick marker, like a Sharpie. You can't get too detailed when your writing tool is beefy!

##### Mid Fidelity Wireframes

We've gotten through our initial brain-dump of ideas with our low fi wireframes, and we have a plan for how we want to structure our content. Our mid fidelity wireframes are where we refine these ideas visually through hierarchy, grids, and image placeholders. It's important that these are still somewhat vague -- we don't want to start pulling in specific images, colors, or fonts yet. We still want to be able to move quickly, so the trick here is to balance tightening up your ideas and layout without getting overly specific and detailed.

##### High Fidelity Wireframes

This is the final, most detailed phase of wireframing. Still in grayscale, with no real images, this phase is where you finalize copy, content, and page flow. At this point, the ideas and structure expressed in your wireframes should be solid enough to be moved into a more formal design phase very easily. Ultimately, wireframes are not design comps. They are not the place we dig into nuanced design choices, rather, they are where we formalize ideas, lock in content, and clarify how users use our site.

Keep in mind that we don't always move through these phases in a structured, formal way. Sometimes the path from low fi to high fi is fairly quick and seamless, but it's good practice to be mindful of where you are in the process so you don't jump ahead and get too detailed too quickly. Wireframes should act as a reference point for you and your thinking about a project, it's ok to make adjustments and tweaks as you refine your layout down the road.


#### Let's Try It Out Together

Let's take a look at the [personal site project spec](http://frontend.turing.edu/projects/personal-site-first-draft.html). Here we see the basic content you'll need to work with in your personal site. Nothing too surprising here, but it's good to understand what you need to be working with before you start sketching. Here's what we need to include:

- primary navigation
- footer
- bio
- past jobs
- education
- goals (*think of this as a mini mission statement. For example, if it is for job hunting then it could be a list of things like "Looking for a collaborative environment"*)
- contact information: github, twitter, etc.
- list of projects with the following information for each:
    + project name
    + project description/overview
    + tools used/learning highlights from project
    + image(s) of project
    + link to project repo and/or site

But wait... we don't have any of this content yet. There aren't any projects to show! How can we start wireframing?

Don't worry! We can actually think of this lack specifics as a good thing -- not having the exact content makes it easy for us to avoid getting bogged down in the details. It might feel odd, but this is all the information we need to get rolling. We know we'll have work to show in the list of projects, so at this stage of the game we're just concerned with understanding what we will include in a very broad sense.

We'll whiteboard an option for low fi and user flow wireframes together.


#### Your Turn

Now that we've done some sketching together, it's your turn! Take a crack at thinking through and sketching low fidelity and user flow wireframes for your personal site. Since we want to iterate quickly and get all our ideas out of our heads and onto paper, **sketch 2-3 different options for your personal site.** Consider how you want to organize your content, what you want a user to see first, and how they'll navigate through the site to different content.

The goal here isn't perfect drawings, it's about communicating your ideas visually in a way that can start discussion. There are lots of ways to approach this project, so be sure to keep your wireframes -- we'll want to discuss them and your approach! A good strategy is to keep things simple: clear and usable beats fancy and confusing any day.
