title: Syllabus Evaluation & Skills Progression
---

## Overview
In order to advance to Module 2, you are required to pass a summative assessment, coined the Pentathlon, conducted in week 6 of the module. Prior to that week, we'll provide feedback regarding your skills through an individual mid-mock assessment in week 3, group project assessments throughout the six weeks, and any other opportunities including, but not limited to: 1-1 pairing, responses we're seeing on weekly quizlettes, participation in class, progress in javascript foundations exercises, progress in static comp challenges.

In order to help you take ownership of your progression in the program and self-assess throughout the module, we've developed a Key Skills. The expectation for advancement to Module 2 is that a student is clearly "Proficient" across each key skill in every area of focus.


## Legend
The legend below _generally_ describes the developmental levels achievable during the six weeks of M1.
The levels build off one another, whereby each increase assumes the expectations from the prior level were met.

|Novice             | Can function but needs a lot of oversight. |
|Advanced Beginner  | Can function with very little oversight. |
|Proficient         | Can confidently implement code without the need for rigid feedback. |
|Exceptional        | Understands and executes advanced concepts. |

For each of the subject matter areas of focus, we've applied these levels with added definition per key skill.
