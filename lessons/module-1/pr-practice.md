## Instructions:

In this repo you will find your name. It is your job to answer the given question. Place your answer next to your name by making a Pull Request on this lesson plan.

### How To PR:

#### Version 1: Directly On Github
* Click on the small pencil icon on this github.com page on the upper right hand corner that says `Edit This File` (make sure you're looking at the file you want to edit)
* Make your changes
* Scroll down to the `Commit Changes` section.
  - The first input field is for the *COMMIT MESSAGE*. This is what will show up in the commit history when the PR is merged.
  - The second input field is for the *BODY* of the commit message. This is where you add additional information that provides important details for future developers.

  Example:
  (commit message): `Edit timeline of lesson plan structure`
  (body): `Previously the lesson was scheduled to be 3 hours but we have cut it down to 2 so we have extra time for questions`

* Click `Propose File Change`
* You are now looking at the Pull Request template - your commit message is automatically rendered in the title of the PR. Add a bit of detail to give a comprehensive title associated with the issue. For the above example: `Update timeline with longer lesson plan`.
* In the body, include a detailed report of why you are making this change, and any important details regarding the process you used. Ie: `@louisa This PR modifies the lesson plans length from 3 hours to 2. Approved by @johnsnow.` (notice you can tag users so they are notified of the PR directly)
* Click `Create Pull Request`.
* Click on the above tab that says "Pull Requests" - you should see your PR in that list.
