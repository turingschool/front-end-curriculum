## Learning Goals

* Review what you know about objects
* Review how to create and access objects and their methods
* Work with nested objects and use objects in functions

## Vocabulary

- `Object` A bundle of behavior (methods) and state (properties)
- `Key` The name used to reference a value on an object
- `Value` The data referenced by a key
- `Property` How we refer to one of the key-value pairs of an object
- `Method` A function on an object
- `Dot Notation` Notation to access a value on an object, explicitly specifies the key

## Part 1: Student Exploration

We will start this lesson with a BIG chunk of work time. You might be thinking - What! We havenâ€™t learned anything yet! Thatâ€™s not true! You already know some stuff about these concepts from Mod 0. Plus, you have problem solving skills (and googling skills ðŸ˜‰).

We want to give YOU a chance to dig into the code and explore before we all get together and talk about these concepts. Itâ€™s okay (and expected!) that some of this activity will be difficult on your own. We want you to get used to that feeling - not knowing all the answers - and start to enjoy the process of diving in and getting your hands dirty in the code!



**Spend one hour working through [this repl](https://replit.com/@kaylaewood/objects#index.js)**. As you're working, write down the following things in your notes:
* Ah-ha moments/Key Points (for example: `You can access values in an object with dot notation.`)
* Questions (for example: `Can you ever have an object inside of another object?`)

If you get stuck...
* Reference [this Intro to Objects lesson](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-1/js-intro-to-objects.html)
* Reference [javascript objects documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics).  Use the search bar and Command+F to search for specific terms and concepts
* Google (for example: `invoke object method javascript`)
* Write down your question/what exactly you're stuck on and move on. Then ask that question when we get on the zoom call!

After this hour, we will continue with the remainder of this lesson guided primarily by your questions.

## Part 2: Class Discussion

### Questions

Asking questions is an essential part of being a developer. Take a few minutes right now to look through your notes from the last hour. What questions do you have about data types, variables, interpolation and concatenation? Everyone should have at least one question! Let's add those questions to [this jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1e3bH0_5I3gb3Jn8pzML9gFH0PelpzzPVZDWVm0nPycA/edit?usp=sharing).

### Key Points

We just went through **a lot** of information. Let's go over the most important things we need to know.
