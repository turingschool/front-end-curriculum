## Getting Started

Projects will always be technically difficult, but tackling the technical challenges gets easier when you have a strong process. Our goal today is to break down and demonstrate that process.

### Project Management Tools
There are a variety of PM tools available, and no one is better than the next. The key is determining will help you most effectively improve your workflow. So try out your options!

### Our "new project"
[Foto Finder](http://frontend.turing.edu/projects/foto-finder-final.html)

We'll be tackling Foto Finder, an old mod 1 project. Our steps will be as follows:

1. Read through the spec
2. Put the requirements into a project management software
3. Determine the goals for an MVP
4. With our plan in mind, wireframe the HMTL to get our structure going

### Structuring Project Boards
There are many ways to structure a project board. Software like Trello or GH Projects work by letting you organize cards into a series of columns. These columns can be used to set things up however you would like!

Cards may be made up of _features_, _user stories_, _tasks_, or all of the above!

Columns can be used to split these cards into a variety helpful categories. Some column types may include:
* To Do
* MVP
* Icebox (nice to add, but not a priority)
* Needs testing
* Awaiting PR
* Master
