# Extra Practice

Below are ways you can get in additional practice throughout the inning. None of these exercises are mandatory, but we find that the more unique problem sets students encounter and complete, the better their coding and problem-solving skills become.

### Test Suites

* [JavaScript Foundations repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript-foundations)
* **Create a new test suite.** Start by making a new test file in a `test` directory and write all of the tests. Then, add in a file in an `exercises` directory and write the code necessary to pass all of the tests you wrote. Send your new suite to your instructors - We may add it into the official test suite!
