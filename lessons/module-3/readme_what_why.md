title: READMEs: The Why and the What
---

## Learning Goals
* Understand the reasons for writing a solid README
* Determine what to include in a README
* Use your README as a tool for your eventual job search

## Vocab
* `Markdown`: a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor; we use this for READMEs
* `README`: a form of documentation for a project directory

  <h3>Warm Up</h3>

  In your breakout rooms...Pretend like you're in an interview and your interviewer asks you to talk about your first paired project in Mod 1. Take turns responding to that prompt. Then discuss:
  - What was easy about answering this question?
  - What was difficult?
  - What would make it easier for you to answer this question in the future?
</section>

## The Why

READMEs are SO important! We often think of them as an afterthought
- the project doesn't matter - the learning, the experience does
- first impression of the work you've done
- helps people know how to see your project (you have write it in a way that non-technical folks can access)
- sometimes employers only scan readme, they don't open the project
- ways to document your experience (gives context to person viewing readme)
- reminds you
- taken cumulatively, it documents your growth

  <h3>Judging READMEs</h3>

  In your breakout rooms, look through the READMEs below. We're going to go for first impressions here, so spend about 1 minute per README. Make some observations about the READMEs and add some stickies to [this Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/15nKXyjArq74u8NzsIJhIzVZsrpFkWLldzSBWPYKchYc/edit?usp=sharing)

  README Links:

### Take Aways

- Too many images
- Not enough content
- Unclear instructions

  <h3>Cohort Challenge</h3>

  Now that we've judged other READMEs, let's practice some humility and have some fun. Take a few minutes to look through your past project READMEs and find your **worst** one.

  Your cohort is now competing for the prize of `Worst README`! Raise your hand if you'd like to join the competition. Take turns screensharing and then vote for the worst!

  Now recognize that we're focused on **growth** here! Let's get better!
</section>

## The What

- set up instructions
- deploy link (if applicable)
- abstract/elevator pitch
- contributors (who did what - what did YOU contribute?)
- wireframe/comp link (only if strong)
- tech stack (include testing + accessibility)
- context (time, # of people, mod, learning goals, what problem is app trying to solve)
- wins/challenges
- future additions (these should be issues as well)
- ONE gif of the highest impact feature of your app

- not one size fits all, think about what you want someone to know AND what you want to remember about this project

  <h3>Updating a README</h3>

  Choose one README from a past project and make some updates to it based on what you've learned in this lesson.

  <h3>Revisiting the Warm Up</h3>

  In your breakout rooms...Pretend like you're in an interview and your interviewer asks you to talk about the project you just updated your README for. Take turns responding to that prompt. Then discuss:
  - Was this easier to answer than the Warm Up question? Why?
  - What work do you need to do on your own to get your READMEs up to par?
