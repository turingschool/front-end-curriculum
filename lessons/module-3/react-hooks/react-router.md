## Learning Goals
* Be able to explain the need for routing
* Be able to implement React Router in a project
* Utilize url params to build dynamic routes

## Vocab
* `BrowserRouter` A \<Router\> that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL
* `Link` Links provide declarative, accessible navigation around your application
* `NavLink` A special version of the \<Link\> that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.
<!-- * `Redirect` Rendering a \<Redirect\> will navigate to a new location. The new location will override the current location in the history stack, like server-side redirects (HTTP 3xx) do.
* `Switch` Renders the first child \<Route\> or \<Redirect\> that matches the location. \<Switch\> is unique in that it renders a route exclusively (only one route wins).
* `match` A match object contains information about how a \<Route path\> matched the URL. -->

## React Router


### Why Routing?

Up until now you've been creating **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** that maybe have utilized conditional rendering based on a boolean in state. Something along the lines of...

```jsx
const App () => {
  const [showWelcome, setWelcome] = useState(true);
  
  return (
    { showWelcome && <Welcome /> }
  )
}
```

This works...but as our applications grow larger and we need to render more components, these conditional toggles can become difficult to manage. Another issue with building Single Page Applications is that you lose the ability to link to any particular state or view of your application because there is no concept of URLs beyond the homepage. 

Suppose you have list of star wars characters and you only want to show a user's favorites when they click on a `Favorites` button... 
You can easily accomplish this with React Router!

Enter [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)

**From the Docs**

React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering.

**In a nutshell...**

React Router allows us to:

* Define which component(s) are rendering based on the URL pathname (dynamic, nested views should have a URL of their own)
* Bookmark specific "page" or view within our application to reference at a later time
* Utilize the `back` and `forward` buttons in our browser

### Router

There are many high-level routers that come with the `react-router-dom` module:

* `<BrowserRouter>` - for current browsers
* `<HashRouter>` - for legacy browsers
* `<MemoryRouter>` - for testing and non-browser environments like React Native
* `<StaticRouter>` - for server side rendering

We will be focusing on **`BrowserRouter`** which is _A Router that uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL._

We will wrap our entire app with this router.

Ultimately it will allow our users to bookmark specific paths and utilize their forward/back buttons. 

There are a few more tools we get with React Router that are important to know about:

<!-- ### Route
The Route component is a key piece of React Router. Its most basic responsibility is to render some UI when a location matches the routeâ€™s path.

The Route component expects a `path` prop (string) that describes the path name.
 
There are 3 ways to render something with a Route:

* `<Route component>`
* `<Route render>`
* `<Route children>`

Let's say we have a `Unicorns` component, here is what it would look like in each of these instances:

**Component**

```jsx
<Route path='/unicorns' component={ Unicorns } />
```

**Render**

```jsx
<Route path='/unicorns' render={ () => <Unicorns /> }
```
This also allows you to define and pass specific properties to a component dynamically. For example:

```jsx
<Route path='/ideas/:id' render={({ match }) => {
  const idea = ideas.find(idea => idea.id === parseInt(match.params.id));
  
  if (!idea) {
    return (<div>This idea does not exist! </div>);  
  }
  return <ListItem match={match} {...idea} />
  
}} />
```

Render differs slightly from Component, let's check out the [docs](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/component) to see what they say about it.

**Children**

```jsx
<Route path='/other-unicorns' children={ () => <Unicorns /> } />
```
It works exactly like render except that it gets called whether there is a match or not.

**Component > Render > Children**

`Component` supersedes `Render` which supersedes `Children` so be sure to only include one within a route.

### Route Props

All three of these are rendered with [route props](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/Route-props), which include: 

* [match](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/match)
* [location](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/location)
* [history](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/history)

**Important Note:** If you have a component that is not rendered by a Route, but still needs access to the route props (match/location/history), you will need to use the `withRouter` method provided by React Router. This will be necessary to make any of your React Router components (Link, Route, Redirect, Switch, etc.) work correctly. Take a few minutes and read [the docs](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/api/withRouter) as well as [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53539314/what-is-withrouter-for-in-react-router-dom) for more info.  -->

### Take the next 10 minutes to read about these components

---

#### Link

_Provides declarative, accessible navigation around your application._

**Things to know:**

* Link can contain an open and closing tag or be a self-closing tag
* Link takes a `to` attribute as well as an optional `replace` attribute
* `to` tells the app which path to redirect to. This can be a string or an object
* `replace` is a boolean that when `true` will replace the current entry in the history stack instead of adding a new one

```jsx
<Link to='/unicorns' />

<Link to='/unicorns'> Unicorns </Link>
```

---

#### NavLink

_A special version of the `<Link>` that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL._

It can take the following attributes:

* **activeClassName: string** - defaults to `active`
* activeStyle: object
* exact: bool
* strict: bool
* isActive: func
* location: object

**Read about each of these [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/NavLink)**

```jsx
<NavLink to='/about'>About</NavLink>
```

---

#### Redirect

_Rendering a `<Redirect>` will navigate to a new location. The new location will override the current location in the history stack, like server-side redirects (HTTP 3xx) do._
More of a nice to know for now. This is something that can be used if the user does something wrong. ie. went to a route they don't have permissions to access.

It can take the following attributes:

* **to: string**
* to: object
* push: bool
* from: string

```jsx
<Redirect to='/not/unicorns' />
```

---

#### Switch

_Renders the **first** child `<Route>` or `<Redirect>` that matches the location. `<Switch>` is unique in that it renders a route **exclusively** (only one route wins). In contrast, every `<Route>` that matches the location renders **inclusively** (more than one route can match and render at a time)_

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Route exact path='/' component={Home} />
  <Route path='/users/add' component={UserAddPage} />
  <Route path='/users' component={UsersPage} />
  <Redirect to='/' />
</Switch>
```

The [docs](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Switch) do a great job of quickly showing what Switch is all about.

# Time to Code!

Enough talk, let's implement React Router!

* Clone [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/react-router-example) and `cd` into it
* checkout the `in-class` branch
* `npm i`
* `npm start`
* open your text editor

---

This application will provide us with a `Main` landing page as well as 3 routes to pages containing:
* Unicorns
* Puppies
* Sharks

Additionally we will add a dynamic route to dig deeper into a specific creatures cards.

First let's install `react-router-dom`

```bash
npm i react-router-dom -S
```

Next let's go import it and wrap <BrowserRouter> around our main entry point `App`:

```jsx
//index.js

import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

const router = (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
)

ReactDOM.render(router, document.getElementById('root'));

```

Next we will go to our `App.js` file and begin constructing the routes for our application. We'll need to import some additional pieces from the library.

```jsx
//App.js

import { Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'
```

Now let's build a header to persist on all views. We will use `NavLink` so we can take advantage of the `active` class. 

<section class="note">
### Note

It comes with a default class of `.active` so we can either use that without defining it, or define a new name using `activeClassName`.
</section>

```jsx
export default class App extends Component {
  
  render() {
    return (
      <main className='App'>
        <header>
          <NavLink to='/unicorns' className='nav'> Unicorns </NavLink>
          <NavLink to='/puppies' className='nav'> Puppies </NavLink>
          <NavLink to='/sharks' className='nav'> Sharks </NavLink>
        </header>
      </main>
    );
  }
}
```

If you click on these links now, you should see the URL change to the routes we told each NavLink to route `to`. 

Next we need to define a `Home` route for when users first arrive to the app (or when the `path='/'`). For now we'll just do a basic welcome message:

```jsx
//Home.js

import React from 'react';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <h4>Click on the links above to see a variety of creatures</h4>
    </section>
  )
}

export default Home;
```

Now let's define the route:

```jsx
//App.js

<Route path='/' component={Home} />
```

<section class="call-to-action">
### In Your Notebook

Next we need to define those routes and tell it which components to render. Take 10 minutes and see if you can get the `/unicorns` Route working by displaying `<h1> Unicorns! </h1>`.

_hint: You'll probably need to create a new component to render when on the `/unicorns` route_
</section>

![unicorn](http://www.chickensmoothie.com/oekaki/image/image.php?id=410567&size=large&format=auto&rev=1302806499)

### Using the component render method

Let's start out with using the `component` render method on a `Route`:

```jsx
//App.js

<Route path='/unicorns' component={Unicorns} />
```

At this point clicking a header link (NavLink) should change the URL and render the component associated with that Route...however, we're still seeing the `Home` component above, what's with that?

This is where we need to use the `exact` attribute on a `Route`

```jsx
//App.js

<Route exact path='/' component={Home} />
```

What we're saying by adding this attribute is that only when the path is **EXACT**ly `'/'` do we want to render the `Home` component.

Now that we have routes defined, and a template of a component, let's get something more fun displaying. Go to your `Unicorns` component and replace what you have with this code:

```jsx
//Unicorns.js

import React from 'react';
import unicornData from './data/unicorn-data'
import './image-display.css';

const Unicorns = () => {
  const displayUnicorns = unicornData.map(unicorn => {
    const { id, image } = unicorn;
    return <img src={image} className='app-img' key={id} />
  });

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Unicorns!</h1>
      {displayUnicorns}
    </>
  );
}

export default Unicorns;
```

We should now be able to see a bunch of unicorns displaying on the page!

<section class="call-to-action">
### Your Turn!

Take some time to mimic these steps for `Puppies` and `Sharks` so that each respective route shows images of their respective creatures.

**A few things to keep in mind:**

* Each component will share classNames and need the `image-display.css` file
* Each component will need their respective data:
	* `unicorn-data.js`
	* `puppy-data.js`
	* `shark-data.js`
</section>

![whaaaat?!](https://i.imgflip.com/160nr0.jpg)

**Let's recap where we're at:**

* We have defined four Routes:
	* `/` 
	* `/unicorns`
	* `/puppies`
	* `/sharks`
* Each route renders a different component
* The `Home` route requires an `exact` attribute because all of the routes contain `/`

### Refactor using the render method

Taking a look at this, you might notice that we have three separate components for unicorns, puppies, and sharks.  This kind of defeats the purpose of React though since we are essentially displaying the same information with different data for each route.  Let's try reusing the same component to display that data!  We can pull the data that is imported inside the App and pass the data down to a `<Creatures />` component using the render attribute on the `<Route />` component.

```jsx
// App.js

  <Route path='/unicorns' render={() => <Creatures data={unicornData} />} />
  <Route path='/puppies' render={() => <Creatures data={puppyData} />} />
  <Route path='/sharks' render={() => <Creatures data={sharkData} />} />
```

```jsx
// Creatures.js

import React from 'react';
import './image-display.css';

const Creatures = ({data}) => {
  const displayCreatures = data.map(creature => {
    const { id, image } = creature;
    return <img src={image} className='app-img' key={id} />
  });

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Creatures!</h1>
      {displayCreatures}
    </>
  );
}

export default Creatures;
```

Hopefully this seems pretty straight forward so far, but what if we want to go a level deeper? When a user clicks on an image, we want to send them to a new view where they can see information specific to _that_ creature only. This is where we get into **dynamic routing**.

### Dynamic Routing

Currently we have 9 creatures per component and we want to be able to link to a specific view for **each creature**. One way we could do this is to create a route for each creature...something like:

```jsx
<Route path='/unicorns/1' />
<Route path='/unicorns/2' />
<Route path='/unicorns/3' />
<Route path='/unicorns/4' />
...
```

This would be incredibly inefficient. Instead, we can use the `render` attribute within our `Route` to dynamically match the id of the URL with the matching ID within our data. 

To signify a dynamic route, you simply add a colon in front of the parameter you're dynamically changing. 

```jsx
path='/unicorns/:id'
```

Let's focus just on unicorns for now. Here are the steps we're working through:

1. A user clicks a specific image
2. We `Link` to a dynamic route where the end of the URL matches the ID of that specific unicorn
3. Based on the ID in the URL, we pass through data specific to that matching unicorn

So, if our first unicorn's data looks like this:
	
```jsx
{ 
  id: 1, 
  name: 'Chuck', 
  image: img1, 
  type: 'unicorns', 
  bio: bio1 
}
``` 
	
We want to redirect to `/unicorns/1`

Then, we want to define a `Route` that looks at the parameter in the URL and passes the specific matching data into something we can render.

Let's poke the bear a little bit. Paste this route into your `App.js` file:

```jsx
//App.js

<Route path='/unicorns/:id' render={({ match }) => {
   console.log(match)
	      
   return (
      <div>New Unicorn Route!</div>
   )
}} />
```

Now visit this URL and open up your console: `http://localhost:3000/unicorns/1`

First thing we should see is that all of our unicorns are still showing, why do you think this is? 

It's because we didn't specify the `exact` attribute in our `/unicorns` route, so that route sees the URL is `/unicorns/1`, considers it a match and renders any components that match. Let's fix this for all three components:

```jsx
//App.js

<Route exact path='/unicorns' render={() => <Creatures data={unicornData} />} />
<Route exact path='/puppies' render={() => <Creatures data={puppyData} />} />
<Route exact path='/sharks' render={() => <Creatures data={sharkData} />} />
```

Ok back to business!

We passed through the `match` prop and console logged it, let's take a look. Notice that the `params` property contains an object with our defined parameter `id`, and it is equal to the ID we linked to in the URL!

Now all we have to do is modify our route to render the correct data.

<section class="call-to-action">
### Your Turn!

See if you can write some code to render the correct data based on the ID in the URL. Focus just on unicorns for now.

**_Hints:_**

* You will need to bring in the data from the `unicorn-data.js` file
* You may want to use the `CreatureDetails` component already set up for you
* Focus first on seeing the data when you type in the URL manually, we'll set up the click next
</section>

![rambo on unicorn](http://pleatedjeans.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/10-28-rambounicorn1.jpg)

Here's the code:

```jsx
<Route path='/unicorns/:id' render={({ match }) => {
	const { id } = match.params
	const creature = unicornData.find(uni => uni.id === parseInt(id))
  return creature && <CreatureDetails {...creature} />
}} />
```

Now if we visit `http://localhost:3000/unicorns/1` we should see a view specifically for Unicorn 1!

<section class="call-to-action">
### Your Turn!

See if you can modify your `Creatures` component so that each image can be clicked and `Link` to the correct Route / path / URL.
</section>

![tunacorn](http://www.nataliedee.com/081905/tuna-plus-unicorn.jpg)

Here's a simple addition to `Creatures.js`.

First we `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'`

Then we just wrap what we returned before with a `<Link>` as such:

```jsx
  const displayCreatures = data.map(creature => {
    const { id, image, type } = creature;
    return (
      <Link to={`/${type}/${id}`} key={id}>      
        <img src={image} className='app-img' />
      </Link>
    )
  });
```

And that's it! Go ahead and work on setting up dynamic routes for the other two components!
