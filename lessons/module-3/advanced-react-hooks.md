## Learning Goals

* Understand what context is in a React application, and why it might be useful
* Understand what an action is, and when to use one
* Understand what a reducer is, and how it relates to an action
* Discuss when a reducer is appropriate, and when it is not

## Vocab

* `context` - an API given to us by React, allowing for the passing of
  information to child components without the use of props
* `reducer` - a pure function, accepting a state & action, and returning a new
  state
* `action` - an object literal, which describes a change to state
* `useContext` - a react hook, allowing functional components to take advantage
  of the context API
* `useReducer` - a react hook, used in place of `useState`, generally for more
  complex state
* `dispatch` - a function returned to us by `useReducer`, which sends action
  objects to the reducer function

## Getting Started

We're going to continue using [this ideabox
repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/react-iii-ideabox) today. Before
going any further please do the following:

* Clone the repo to your machine
* Switch to the `using-hooks-advanced` branch
* Run `npm install` in the repo

## Context and useContext

Although you may not have been aware of it, Context is something that's been
available to you already in React, it's not something new along with hooks.
Up until this point, whenever you wanted to pass something from one component to
another, you've used props.

However, when you have to pass something across and down through many
components, this can become really cumbersome. Context allows us to make data
available to all child components without passing it via props.

### An example

Imagine we wanted to pass down a theme to all of our components, either "light"
or "dark", which would change the appearance of our components. This would be
an excellent use case for Context:

First, we need to create a context which will be available to our Component
tree:

```javascript
// ThemeContext.js

import React, { createContext } from 'react'

const ThemeContext = createContext()

export default ThemeContext
```

There isn't much to this file, however we'll need to import it wherever we are
providing or consuming context.

Here's how we can provide that context to everything inside of App, and toggle
the theme based on the click of a button. Note the import of ThemeContext, the
new call to useState, the toggleTheme function, and the updates to the return.

```jsx
// App.js

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Ideas from './Ideas';
import Form from './Form';
import ThemeContext from './ThemeContext';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [ideas, setIdeas] = useState([])
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Ideabox (${ideas.length})`
  })

  const addIdea = (newIdea) => {
    setIdeas([...ideas, newIdea]);
  }

  const deleteIdea = (id) => {
    const filteredIdeas = ideas.filter(idea => idea.id !== id);

    setIdeas(filteredIdeas);
  }

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    const newTheme = theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'
    setTheme(newTheme)
  }

  return(
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <main className='App'>
        <h1>IdeaBox</h1>
        <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
        <Form addIdea={addIdea} />
        <Ideas ideas={ideas} deleteIdea={deleteIdea} />
      </main>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

export default App;
```

Now, we'll need to update any file that we want to access that context!

### The useContext hook

Before hooks, we would have use of `ThemeContext.Consumer` in order get the
context out of the component hierarchy. However, using the new `useContext`
hook, we can easily tell any component to grab the value for a particular
context.

`useContext` takes one argument, the context which it should look in the tree
for, and returns the value that it finds for that context.

Here, we're getting the theme in our Card component, and then passing that theme
as a new className to our Card div.

```jsx
// Card.js

import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import './Card.css';
import ThemeContext from './ThemeContext'

const Card = ({ title, description, id, deleteIdea, isFavorited }) => {
  const value = useContext(ThemeContext)

  return (
    <div className={`card ${isFavorited && 'favorite'} ${value}`}>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>{description}</p>
      <button onClick={() => deleteIdea(id)}>ðŸ—‘o</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Card;
```

Finally, update the Card.css file to define some classes based on our "light"
and "dark" themes.

```css
.card {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 3px solid black;
  padding: 10px;
}

.light {
  color: black;
  background: white
}

.dark {
  color: white;
  background: black;
}
```

Now we can change the theme that's being passed into our `ThemeContext.Provider`
back in `App.js`, and our `Card` component will know about it. Cool!!

### When to use context

When you have some piece of data that is needed by a large portion of your
application.

### When not to use context

When data is only needed by one component or a component and its immediate
children. As you've discovered adding context is not as simple as passing a
prop, so if passing a prop is the easier route, go that way. Don't add the extra
complexity unless you're getting a clear win.

## Reducers, Actions, useReducer, and dispatch

As applications grow in complexity, our state trees can quickly get out of hand.
If you have only a few pieces of state referenced in your top most component, it
will be pretty easy to figure out how all the pieces of state are used, and how
they're updated. But what if you have 100?

One of the best patterns that has emerged to address this complexity is the
Reducer.

At it's core, a Reducer is just a function responsible for managing changes to
state. It decides how update state based on what kinds of actions are dispatched
to it.

### Actions

An action is a regular JavaScript object which describes a change to state.
Considering our previous example of theme, an action might look like this:

```javascript
const ourAction = {
  type: 'TOGGLE_THEME'
}
```

An action doesn't do anything by itself, it's just an instruction. However, by
convention, all actions must have a _type_ key. This type key will be used by
the reducer that the action is ultimately dispatched to. Other key/value pairs can
optionally be included in the object as well.

### Reducer

Just like an action, a Reducer is just plain old JavaScript, but it follows a
very specific pattern. A Reducer takes a state and an action as arguments, and it
returns a new state. Based on our previous action, our reducer might look like
this:

```javascript
// assume our state is an object with the following shape:
// {
//   theme: 'light',
// }

const ourReducer = (state, action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'TOGGLE_THEME':
      const newTheme = state.theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'
      return {...state, theme: newTheme}
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

One very important rule to follow with Reducers is to make sure they are _pure_.
This means that the arguments passed into the function must remain unchanged,
and the same input will always yield the same output.

### useReducer

`useReducer` is a React hook which enables the use of this advanced pattern.
When you call `useReducer`, you must pass the reducer (function) that will be
used, and your initial state. It's important to remember that `useReducer` is
generally used in place of `useState` in a component, because they're solving
the same problem.

```javascript
const initialState = {
  theme: 'light',
}

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(ourReducer, initialState)
```

From this invocation, your are given the state associated with the reducer you
just created, and a new, special, function called _dispatch_.

### dispatch

When we use the `useReducer` hook, the second item we are given is a function called
`dispatch`. The sole responsibility of dispatch is to take Actions, and send
them to the Reducer. Dispatch is smart, so it will call the Reducer for us, with
the correct state. All we need to do is pass the Action in.


```javascript
const ourAction = {
  type: 'TOGGLE_THEME'
}

dispatch(ourAction)
```

### An example

In the code below, we've replaced our `useState` for theme with a Reducer, and
have updated the `toggleTheme` method to make use of our `dispatch` method. All
the logic for how the theme should be updated now lives in the reducer.

```jsx
// App.js

import React, { useState, useEffect, useReducer } from 'react';
import Ideas from './Ideas';
import Form from './Form';
import ThemeContext from './ThemeContext';
import './App.css';

const initialState = {
  theme: 'light'
}

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'TOGGLE_THEME':
      const newTheme = state.theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'
      return {...state, theme: newTheme}
    default:
      return state
  }
}

function App() {
  const [ideas, setIdeas] = useState([])
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Ideabox (${ideas.length})`
  })

  const addIdea = (newIdea) => {
    setIdeas([...ideas, newIdea]);
  }

  const deleteIdea = (id) => {
    const filteredIdeas = ideas.filter(idea => idea.id !== id);

    setIdeas(filteredIdeas);
  }

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    const action = { type: 'TOGGLE_THEME' }
    dispatch(action)
  }

  return(
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={state.theme}>
      <main className='App'>
        <h1>IdeaBox</h1>
        <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
        <Form addIdea={addIdea} />
        <Ideas ideas={ideas} deleteIdea={deleteIdea} />
      </main>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

export default App;
```

This is great, however now we're using `useReducer` to handle the state of the
theme, and `useState` for the ideas. That's not ideal.

<section class="call-to-action">
### Your Turn

Continue to refactor our `App.js` to make more complete use of our reducer. You
will need to:

* Update the initial state to store an array of ideas as well
* Get rid of our call to `useState`
* Update our Reducer to handle actions which describe adding new ideas, and
  those which describe removing ideas
* Update the `addIdea` and `deleteIdea` methods to dispatch actions, rather than
  setting anything
* HINT: The logic that is currently sitting in `addIdea` and `deleteIdea` will
  need to move into your Reducer
* SECOND HINT: Your state is coming from your reducer now, so you'll have to
  watch out for places when you used it in the component

### Here's how to do it, don't look until you try!!

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useReducer } from 'react';
import Ideas from './Ideas';
import Form from './Form';
import ThemeContext from './ThemeContext'
import './App.css';

const initalState = {
  ideas: [],
  theme: 'dark'
}

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'TOGGLE_THEME':
      const newTheme = state.theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'
      return {...state, theme: newTheme}
    case 'ADD_IDEA':
      return {...state, ideas: [...state.ideas, action.idea]}
    case 'REMOVE_IDEA':
      const filteredIdeas = state.ideas.filter(idea => idea.id !== action.id);
      return {...state, ideas: filteredIdeas}
    default:
      return state
  }
}

function App() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initalState)

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Ideabox (${state.ideas.length})`
  })

  const addIdea = (newIdea) => {
    const action = { type: 'ADD_IDEA', idea: newIdea }
    dispatch(action)
  }

  const deleteIdea = (id) => {
    const action = { type: 'REMOVE_IDEA', id }
    dispatch(action)
  }

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    const action = { type: 'TOGGLE_THEME' }
    dispatch(action)
  }

  return(
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={state.theme}>
      <main className='App'>
        <h1>IdeaBox</h1>
        <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
        <Form addIdea={addIdea} />
        <Ideas ideas={state.ideas} deleteIdea={deleteIdea} />
      </main>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

export default App
```
</section>

Now all the logic for how our application may be updated lives in one place.
Awesome!!

## The Big Picture: Using Context and Reducers together

So, Context gives us a way to pass information to our whole application without
using props, and Reducers give us predictable pattern for how our state will
update. Using these two concepts together is very powerful, and will allow you
to build much larger applications while keeping them maintainable.

Consider the following code example:

```jsx
 import React, { useState, useEffect, useReducer } from 'react';
 import Ideas from './Ideas';
 import Form from './Form';
 import AppContext from './AppContext'
 import './App.css';

 const initalState = {
   ideas: [],
   theme: 'dark'
 }

 const reducer = (state, action) => {
   switch(action.type) {
     case 'TOGGLE_THEME':
       const newTheme = state.theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'
       return {...state, theme: newTheme}
     case 'ADD_IDEA':
       return {...state, ideas: [...state.ideas, action.idea]}
     case 'REMOVE_IDEA':
       const filteredIdeas = state.ideas.filter(idea => idea.id !== action.id);
       return {...state, ideas: filteredIdeas}
     default:
       return state
   }
 }

 function App() {
   const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initalState)

   useEffect(() => {
     document.title = `Ideabox (${state.ideas.length})`
   })

   const toggleTheme = () => {
     const action = { type: 'TOGGLE_THEME' }
     dispatch(action)
   }

   return(
     <AppContext.Provider value={[state, dispatch]}>
       <main className='App'>
         <h1>IdeaBox</h1>
         <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
         <Form />
         <Ideas />
       </main>
     </AppContext.Provider>
   )
 }

 export default App;
```

<section class="call-to-action">
### Time to get SPICY!!!

The code example above has passed the state _and_ the dispatch function returned
from the Reducer into the Context. The name of the Context has been changed
since it's no longer just for the Theme, but the mechanics of what it is doing
are the same.

Spend the rest of the class, and as homework, working to get the application
back to the same functionality.

* You should not add any props to the <Form /> or <Ideas /> components
* You will need to make use of `useContext` in the child components
* You will need to make use of `dispatch` in the child components
* Good luck!!
