### Professional Skills

The Professional Skills segment is made up of several pieces, most of which are to be submitted by 9AM on Monday of Week 6, except for the Flower Exercise (see below). It's suggested that you send them earlier if possible.

* Flower Exercise is submitted as a gist or uploaded PDF to your portfolio. **However, you will need a draft of it on the first day of week 5 for the Job Search Action Plan session.** Be prepared to have that finished at the beginning of week 5.
* Following up on the *Organize Your Shit* session, ensure that your GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow accounts are properly setup by linking to them in your Census account. We will run an automated check on these and send you a follow up if needed. No submission is necessary beyond putting the info in your Census account.
* Following up on the *Portfolio Tips & Tricks* tutorial, notify [Meg via email](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) that your portfolio is complete with your name, photo, description, three projects, and resume.
* Following the *Finding Opportunities* session, add [Meg](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) as a collaborator to your Trello board with 10 companies. No other submission is necessary.
* Following up on the *Job Search Action Plan* & *Flower Exercise Follow-Up*, submit to [Meg via email](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) a plan following the supplied template in a gist by the submission time above and include the gist in your portfolio.

### Community & Feedback

Feedback from other students and to other students in either project groups, posses, general interaction, etc.  

Discuss ways that you supported the larger Turing community. What do you want to keep doing next mod or start doing next mod?  

## Skill Expectations

* Begin learning the process by which business requirements are turned into acceptance requirements
* Introduce how acceptance requirements are turned into stories and feature requirements
* How stories are estimated
* How pull requests are used to organize discussion about features
* How project management tools are used to communicate across technical teams and stakeholders/clients

#### Interpersonal Skills

* Asking high quality questions of people or StackOverflow
* Effective collaboration techniques for remote teams
* Effective communication around code, explaining what it does and why
