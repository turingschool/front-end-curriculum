## Portfolio Expectations

Your portfolio is how you demonstrate the depth and breadth of your skill mastery during the module. A successful F3 portfolio will include each of the following segments.

### End of Module Assessment

Students must earn a 3 or greater on *each* segment of the End of Module Assessment rubric.

### Individual Work

### Group Work

(forthcoming)


### Professional Skills

The Professional Skills segment is made up of several pieces, most of which are to be submitted by 9AM on Monday of Week 6, except for the Flower Exercise (see below). It's suggested that you send them earlier if possible.

* Flower Exercise is submitted as a gist or uploaded PDF to your portfolio. **However, you will need a draft of it on the first day of week 5 for the Job Search Action Plan session.** Be prepared to have that finished at the beginning of week 5. 
* Following up on the [*Organize Your Shit*](backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_four/organize_your_shit) session, ensure that your GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow accounts are properly setup by linking to them in your Census account. We will run an automated check on these and send you a follow up if needed. No submission is necessary beyond putting the info in your Census account.
* Following up on the *Portfolio Tips & Tricks* tutorial, notify [Meg via email](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) that your portfolio is complete with your name, photo, description, three projects, and resume.
* Following the *Finding Opportunities* session, add [Meg ](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) as a collaborator to your Trello board with 10 companies. No other submission is necessary.
* Following up on the *Job Search Action Plan* & *Flower Exercise Follow-Up*, submit to [Meg via email](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) a plan following the supplied template in a gist by the submission time above and include the gist in your portfolio.
