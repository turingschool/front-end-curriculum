## Turing Culture: Developing Empathetic Programmers
_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### Why Empathy?
* Interpersonal skills (including empathy) have a direct, significant impact on your professional success.
* Empathy is a foundational interpersonal skill. Other skills, such as collaboration, communication, compromise all hinge on your ability to demonstrate empathy.
* Interpersonal skills, including empathy, can be developed and improved.
* Turing's mission (cited above) demands that we support students development of technical _and_ interpersonal skills. 

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Read
Read _two_ of the following articles/videos (we recommend all of them!) and reflect on these questions: why are we talking about empathy at a software development school? how can you develop the "skill" of empathy? and why should you care?

* ["Why is Empathy Important for Design"](http://www.bresslergroup.com/blog/why-empathic-design/)
* ["The Surprising (Nontechnical) Skill You Need to Succeed in Tech"](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-surprising-and-nontechnical-skill-you-need-to-succeed-in-tech), _The Muse_
* ["Why Aren't We More Compassionate?"](http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_goleman_on_compassion#t-39146), TED Talk (Daniel Goleman)
* ["Can you teach people to have empathy?"](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33287727), BBC (Jun 29, 2015)

#### Reflect
After reading the articles above, create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following prompts.
* What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?
* How does empathy help you build better software?
* Why is empathy important for working on a team?
* Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.
* When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?
