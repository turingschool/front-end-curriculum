## What is Impostor Syndrome?

Impostor Syndrome occurs when high-achieving individuals aren't able to internalize their accomplishments and abilities and instead become convinced that they will be exposed as "frauds." In other words, this phenonmenon occurs when one is learning something, getting better at it, but still feels behind. This is a common feeling while at Turing, and we have a student group that meets on Wednesdays at lunch to discuss this feeling and how to move past it (join the #impostors channel on Slack to find out more). But the bottom line is -- *you are meant to be here and you can do this.* Below are some resources to help remind you of your capabilities.
