## Deliverables
- Website copy
- Plan for personal site

### Website Learning Competencies
- Effectively tell your story and introduce your skills to the tech community by way of personal website
- Demonstrate rather than tell

### Layout
Consider what story you want to tell? Are you demonstrating how your previous experience flows over to your skills as a Software Developer? Would you like to demonstrate your ability to build a beautiful, effective website? Are you eager to showcase your projects? Whatever it is you would like your reader/viewer to experience, consider how that will impact your website design and layout.

### Your Turn
- Wire frame the layout of your site to display:
	- Introduction to who you are
	- Your projects
	- Demonstrate transferable skills
	- Links to your social media sites: LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc.

- Introduce yourself:
	- Dive deeper into the summary you used on your LinkedIn. Be sure it answers the following questions:
		- Who are you? As a developer, contributor to the tech industry, teammate, career changer, community member, human being
		- How did you get here? Why Software Development? Why Now?
		- What's next? What are your ambitions or long term goals? How do you want to contribute to the tech industry?

- Showcase your projects and skills
	- Build your site from scratch
	- Include links to your code source
	- Include links to engage with your end product
