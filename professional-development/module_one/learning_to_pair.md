# Learning to Pair: How to Define the Relationship and Hold Each Other Accountable

Pairing with other programmers is an essential agile practice, and building your pairing skills will help you be successful in projects at Turing and in the workplace. Learning to pair is about establishing a relationship with the person you’re working with. This starts with breaking down communication barriers and building trust within the working relationship. This session covers how to DTR (Define the Relationship), strategies for upholding expectations with your partner(s), how to have difficult conversations when group members break expectations, and how to give each other feedback.

Refer to the [Learning to Pair slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_ZfOvYNMeOQeks4CBioyMZy3mm_5pWdyX6Tp9Ej4OLw/edit?usp=sharing) for this lesson.

## Learning Objectives:

* Identify various forms of pair programming
* Understand what DTR is and how to hold a DTR conversation
* Define your own expectations in a working relationship
* Apply strategies to hold your partners accountable
* Demonstrate how to address broken expectations

## Deliverable:

* Include a DTR memo in your portfolio for at least one project

## Opening
In the past when you've worked in teams, what was successful about them? What was unsuccessful?

You'll often find similar experiences happen in pair programming. This session will help you discover tools to navigate this relationship in a way that it's a great learning experience for you both. 

## Types of pair programming
[Pair programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/) can take many forms, and here are some suggestions of how you can approach pairing at Turing:

* **Driver-Navigator:** Driver has control of the keyboard while the Navigator guides the Driver towards the end goal.

	Roles: Driver types and hones muscle memory through minute-to-minute typing while the Navigator pays attention to the code being written 
	
	Tips: Switch these roles up throughout a work session!
	
	Potential pitfall: The Navigator stops paying attention, and the Driver starts doing their own thing. Active participation and constant communication is crucial for this pairing to be successful.
	
* **Ping Pong pairing:** This looks like side-by-side pairing. This could include 2 mice and 2 keyboards. 

	Roles: 
	
	Tips: 
	
	Potential pitfall: 
	
* **Distributed Pairing (Remote Pairing):** 


	Roles: 
	
	Tips: 
	
		* Invest in a good headset
		* Experiment with ScreenHero to build your comfort with using it
		* Be more vocal about when to switch Driver and Navigator roles
	
	Potential pitfall: 
	


## Defining the Relationship (DTR)
DTR refers to a conversation each student has with group partner(s) before launching into a project. During this conversation, group members set expectations for how to work together. Use this [DTR Guiding Questions & Memo template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zMtgWhODQuP3KBNhrg6PtmPUkw0DIskqgggeyEzYZi4/edit?usp=sharing) to guide the conversation.

Establishing a relationship with your mentor should also include a DTR. Here’s a cheatsheet for planning that conversation.

Take time to define your expectations:

### Examples:
* Define your strengths -- what do you bring to the table?
* How do you want to collaborate with someone else?
* How do you approach problems?
* What do you want Git workflow to look like?
* How do you appreciate communication from others?
* Imagine that you might be working with someone with a very different personality than yours -- **how will you communicate your expectations so that you’re on the same page?**
* What is your schedule like? What work-life boundaries do you need to communicate to your partner?
* Come up with additional questions that you want to ask your partner


### Holding Each Other Accountable
* Memo: Documenting your DTR in a memo will provide you with a record of what you discussed to reference as the project goes on. Make it into a gist so that everyone from the group has it.
* Stand Up: Start each work session discussing what you are each working on that day and what goals you hope to accomplish at the end of the work session.
* Retro: Hold regular retros to discuss what’s going well, what’s not going well, and what you should change as a group to make your project and team more successful.
	* Check out this example of [retro notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qX18S_Ok2IQA5kRB2vdblF61XbO3nX-oTWFkfgA0L8k/edit?usp=sharing)
* Re-DTR: In longer projects, review and readjust expectations midway through the project.


### Compromising with each others’ expectations
* Remember lessons from Improv:
	* “No” means that you’re pushing your own agenda
	* “Yes” means that you’re expecting your partner to do all the work of defining expectations (even if you don’t agree with these expectations)
	* “Yes and” means that you’re collaborating and building on each other’s ideas for the good of the group
* Beware of the Paired Project Fallacy:
	* My partner is better than I am OR I’m not as good as my partner.
* Why is this a fallacy?
	* This is a fallacy because it discounts all the important skills you both bring to your partnership.
	* If you don’t feel as strong in your technical skills, what are your strengths? How do your strengths balance out your partner’s? How can you contribute to the project management? What do you want to learn during this project to improve your technical skills?
	* If you feel like you have stronger technical skills, teaching your partner will help you solidify these skills. Alternatively, what can you learn from your partner?
	* Beware of the "Developer's Ego" -- learning to ask questions is an important skill for the workplace.
* Bottom line: Paired project code is owned by the entire team. There is no room (and no time, considering your tight deadlines) for egos -- you are here to support each other.

### Addressing Broken Expectations
When a partner is not following through on expectations, the first step is to work on yourself:

* How are you reacting?
	* Silence (avoiding the situation; passive aggression; using sarcasm). By not addressing the situation, it looks like you actually approve of what the other person did.
	* Violence (yelling; personal attacks). By reacting this way, it looks like you are hard to work with and are abusive when things don’t go your way.
	* Fundamental Attribution Error. This error comes from an assumption that others are doing contrary things because it’s part of their makeup or that they don’t care rather than considering other potential motivational forces
* How to fix these reactions:
	* Humanize the situation: analyze why the other person could have broken these social norms
	* Consider the 6 Sources of Influence:
		* Personal:
			* Motivation (does the person want/not want to do this?)
			* Ability (does the person have the ability to do this or not?)
		* Social:
			* Motivation (peer pressure -- from teammates, instructors, etc.)
			* Ability (what help does your partner need from others?)
				* Think about how you’re contributing to the social aspect as well: pay attention to body language, tone of voice, etc.
		* Structural:
			* Motivation (deadlines, grades, etc.)
			* Ability (What is structurally holding you back? Do you need a better organizational system? Trello, waffle.io, etc.)

### Facilitating the Conversation
Now that you’ve identified a motivation behind your partner’s behavior, how do you conduct a conversation to change that behavior?

* **Establish safety**: you’re about to address something sensitive with another person and he/she may feel threatened in one way or another.
	* **Mutual Respect**: People feel unsafe when they don’t feel mutual respect
		* **Fix**: calm tone of voice, facial expressions, and using respectful language
		* Ask for permission to speak with your partner
		* Speak in private
	* **Mutual Purpose**: People feel unsafe when they don’t feel that there is a mutual purpose for resolving the problem
		* **Fix**: Phrase your conversation around the goals of the project instead of you vs. your partner
* Use Contrasting: “Don’t/Do Statement”
	* Example: “I don’t want you to think that I don’t value your ideas. You’ve contributed a lot of great ideas to the project. I do want to talk about how we could discuss ideas as a group before making a decision.”
* Describe what’s happened:
	* Start with **Facts**. What exactly happened? *Be careful of **NOT** inserting your opinion of what happened.*
		* “We agreed that we would make big decisions together, but during the check-in, you told our instructor that you had already decided to implement that new feature before you discussed it with me.”
	* Describe how the incident made you feel:
		* “When you said that, it made me feel like you didn’t value my input and that you weren’t taking our expectations seriously.”
	* **Ask** for the other person’s side:
		* “What is your take on this?”
* Following up after stating your side:
	* Listen to the other person’s side
	* Analyze the response & go back to the 6 sources of influence:
		* Is the problem due to **motivation** or **ability**?
		* Discuss consequences related to your **mutual purpose**:
			* “If we don’t make decisions together, our project will suffer.”
		* Discuss new expectations if the issue is motivation:
			* “It sounds like you made that the decision because you felt pressure from the instructor to have a new idea in place at the check-in. Let’s redefine our goals for each check-in.”
		* Discuss finding resources if the issue is ability:
			* “You made the decision because you couldn’t reach me. Let’s find 3 mutual times we can check in throughout the day.”
		* Create action steps:
			* Re-DTR: who will do what and when?

### Practice

**Scenario:** During DTR, Partner A and Partner B decided that you would have an end of day retro to debrief how the worktime went. But at the end of the first day, Partner A left abruptly right after Wrap Up and didn’t meet with Partner B to retro on the tasks. Then in day two, Partner A doesn’t have a task finished that was promised to be done. Partner B is worried about time and how to proceed when Partner A seems unreliable.
* What assumptions need to be addressed?
* How will you conduct the conversation?
* Debrief: what was easy or difficult about having this conversation?
