#Johari Window Activity


###Background

Created by psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham in 1955 (and named for them, combining the names Joe and Harry), the Johari Window is a technique used to help people better understand their relationship with themselves and others.

###Complete Your Johari Window

**Step One**:
Look through the list of adjectives below and pick some that you feel describe your personality. Your peers, specifically those you've worked with in projects, will also pick an equal number of adjectives from the list that describe you. 

**Step Two:**
Sort the adjectives to each of the four quadrants in the [Johari Window](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IFaKPTEA3V96i8cboxqeAfgKEyEbigwIxQ5KQ-lp440/edit?usp=sharing). Start with the **Arena** (sometimes called Open) to list the adjectives that were selected by both you and your peers. This quadrant represents traits of which both you and your peers are aware.

**Step Three:**
Next, sort the adjectives that were only selected by you and not your peers. These go into the **Facade** (sometimes called Hidden) quadrant. These represent information about you of which your peers are unaware. It is up to you to disclose this information to others.

**Step Four:**
Next, sort adjectives that were selected by your peers but not by you into the **Blind Spot** quadrant. These represent information of which you might not be aware but others are.  

**Step Five:**
Adjectives that were not selected by either you or your peers remain in the **Unknown** quadrant. These traits might not apply or because there is a collective ignorance of their existence in your behavior.
