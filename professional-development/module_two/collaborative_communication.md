# Collaborative Communication

[Slides for this lesson](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/CollaborativeCommunication_BEE%20M2.pdf)

## Pre-Reading from *How to Win Friends & Influence People in the Digital Age*:

* [Chapter 4: Ask Questions Instead of Giving Direct Orders from How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age](../files/Chapter%204%20Ask%20Questions%20Instead%20of%20Giving%20Direct%20Orders.pdf)
* [Chapter 5: Mitigate Fault from How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age](../files/Chapter%205%20Mitigate%20Fault.pdf)

## Learning Objectives:

* Describe how to use agile practices with teams
* Describe how you can use your strengths and leadership skills to be an effective team member
* Describe and utilize strategies for communicating with team members when mistakes/failures happen

## Connections:
* Success in M2: M2 is where you hone your teamwork skills. Understanding and using project management best practices is essential to becoming an effective team member.
* Success in career: Your technical skills will help you get a job. Your project management and communication skills will help you *keep* a job. Demonstrating that you can successfully work with teams and learn from mistakes in a productive way will be a huge asset to any organization

## Deliverable:
Paragraph reflection in your portfolio on:

* Details on project management strategies you used in your projects (Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?

## Opening
Recap project management and agile practices:

* Waterfall vs. Agile
* Tuckman's
* Waffle
* Git Workflow

How do these practices relate to the success of a team?

## Leadership in Teams
**Discuss Chapter 4 in small groups:**

* What was this chapter about?
* Do you agree with this approach? Why/why not?
* What does it mean to be a good leader?
* How can you replicate this approach within teams, especially when there’s a project manager?

**Whole Group Discussion: Project Managers**

Building off of your small group discussion, how would you define the role of the project manager?

Back in your small groups, define the role of the project manager for your group. 

**Goal-Planning Activity:**

	SCENARIO: Your group discussed skill levels and expectations in your DTR, and during the first iteration 
	of Bike Share, Teammate A drives while Teammate B navigates and (if applicable) Teammate C looks up 
	documentation. Teammate A insists on going down a route he/she claims to feel comfortable with. Teammate B 
	asks a few questions, looking confused, but then falls silent as Teammate A continues to drive and gives 
	little explanation for what he/she is doing. Teammate C vocalizes that he/she has found a better way 
	to complete the iteration based on some documentation, but Teammate A answers that his/her way will be 
	better. During the group’s next check-in, Teammate A presents the code he/she produced, takes credit for 
	it, and the other teammates sit silently. Discuss what should be done in this situation as a team. 
	
	* How can the project manager help in this situation? What would you do if Teammate A was your project 
	manager?
	* How will each of you exemplify leadership within your team, whether you are the project manager or 
	not?
	* Discuss one (or more) of the agile practices you learned about in the Project Management lesson. 
	Which one(s) will you use in your team? What will that look like?

## How to handle Failure:
**Discuss Chapter 5 in small groups:**

* What was this chapter about?
* What does it look like to actually learn from and move past mistakes?
* Why did I have you read this?

**Whole Group Debrief:**

How can this chapter be applied to software teams?

**Fear-Planning Activity:**

	SCENARIO: During your DTR for your project, Teammate A expresses that he/she wants to take on some new 
	features that he/she has never done before. Teammates B and (if applicable) C aren’t sure about this. 
	There is so much to get done, they want to just stick to what they know how to do well. What system can 
	your team create to allow team members to take risks and try out new things in the project? What will 
	your team do if Teammate A “fails”? How will your team communicate?
	
	Discuss the above scenario using the prompts below:
		* Acknowledge that failure happens. How can we do that in our team? What will that look like?
		* Encourage dialogue to foster trust. How can you establish honest communication within your 
		team?
		* Separate the person from the failure. How can you create a sense of safety in your team? How 
		will you mitigate fault?
		* Learn from your mistakes. How can you turn a mistake into an opportunity?
		* Create a risk-taking and failure system. How can you make your team a safe place to take risks?

## Individual Reflections
Answer these questions in your journal:

* How will you use your strengths in your Bike Share team?
* Continue fear-planning by creating individual goals for yourself:
	* How can you help the team learn from and move past mistakes?
	* What efforts can you personally take to ensure you don’t blame others for “failures”? What could you do instead?
