###You’re not a Role
When people have asked you what you do in the past, what have you said? “I was a construction worker.” “I was a marketing manager.” “I was a teacher.” Sound familiar? These kind of declarations lock you into a role; but you’re not a role, you’re a person with many skills and many experiences.

Instead, try saying “I’m a person who…”

* "I’m a person who...is skilled at building things.”
* “I’m a person who...has experience in creating stories to attract customers.”
* “I’m a person who...knows how to explain concepts to others in smaller pieces.”

In this session, you’ll explore who you are from 7 different angles to discover what you want as you start looking for a job. **Because you are not just a software developer now, you are a person who has very specific skills, talents, experience, and goals that make you so much more than a software developer.**

###The Seven Petals
I am a person who…has 7 sides to me:

1. Describe who you are in terms of what you know (favorite knowledges and/or fields of interest)
	* Examples: teaching, writing, providing services to others, etc.
2. Describe who you are in terms of the kinds of people you most prefer to work with and/or the kinds of people you would most like to serve
	* Examples:
		* Work with: Creative people; collaborative teams
		* Serve: People from a certain geographical area; people with certain needs, etc.
3. Describe who you are in terms of what you can do and what your favorite functional/transferable skills are
	* Examples: Project management skills; mentoring/teaching
4. Describe who you are in terms of your favorite working conditions
	* Examples: small company/large company/start-up; remote/in-person
5. Describe who you are in terms of your preferred salary and level of responsibility
	* Examples: working by yourself vs. member of a team vs. supervising others vs. running your own business
6. Describe who you are in terms of your preferred geographical location or surroundings
	* Examples: here or abroad; warm/cold, north/south, east/west, mountains/coast, urban/suburban/rural/rustic -- where would you be happiest, do your best work, and would most like to live?
7. Describe who you are in terms of your goals or sense of mission and purpose for your life. Or the goals/mission you want the organization to have where you decide to work

All 7 aspects are important for your job search; Why?

* If a job only matches 1 or 2 “petals,” it will not be fulfilling to you because it will only allow you to express one or two sides of yourself
* This picture is the most complete of you and defining these aspects will lead you to your dream job

###Tools
Complete [these worksheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing) to fulfill the brainstorming stages of the Flower Exercise

* Petal #1: Favorite Knowledges And/Or Fields of Interest
	* Goal: Summarize everything you know; Must have: knowledge from past experiences; Bonus: What you would like to learn
	* Tips: Knowledges are nouns
	* What You know from the past:
		* Go through everything you know; if you worked at Panera, this could mean you list “learned how to prepare and serve food, how to wait on customers, how to make change, how to deal with complaints, how to train new employees, etc.” Then go back and highlight the most important pieces to you -- which are you most satisfied with?
	* What you know outside of work:
		* What knowledge have you picked up outside of work?
		* Examples: Things learned in high school/college that you still value today; anything from training seminars, conferences, etc.; anything you learned at home or via the internet
	* What industries sound interesting to you:
Start broadly and then make more specific
	* Worksheet & Favorite Subjects Matrix
* Petal #2: Preferred Kinds of People to Work With
	* Background: People we work with either give us energy or drain our energy. They’re very important to how we work.
	* Goal: To avoid past bad experiences with people at work, focus on the people you most like to work with
	* Looking for:
		* Better picture in your mind of what kind of people surrounding you at work will enable you to operate at your highest and most effective level.
		* Better picture in your mind of what kind of people you would most like to serve or help: defined by age, problems, geography, etc.
		* Tips: These are descriptions -- adjectives
	* Party Game Exercise
		* Looking at the graphic for the party, answer these questions by writing down the letter:
			1. Which corner of the room would you be drawn to as the group of people you’d want to be around longest?
			2. 15 mins. Later, everyone in that corner leaves for another party, except you. Of the groups that remain, which group would you be drawn to now?
			3. 15 mins. Later, this group also leaves. Of the remaining groups, which do you join?
