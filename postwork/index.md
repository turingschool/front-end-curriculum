title: Front-End Postwork
---

After you leave Turing you will undoubtedly have a bookmarks tab full of all the technology you should be learning, all the blog posts you should read, all the videos you should watch, etc etc etc.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, **this postwork document is meant to be a small list of resources and advice to keep your skills sharp in the next 3 to 6 months**.

While you're in the **interview process**, have an answer to the question `what have you done since you graduated?`.

During your **first six months of the job**, have an answer to the question `why do you deserve a raise?`.

Pick a chunk of time _every day_ that you'll dedicate to working through these resources. Define success for yourself by having a hard stop.

For example, if you're on vacation, commit to doing two hours of code with your morning coffee. At the two hour mark, close your computer and allow yourself to enjoy the rest of the day. You might end up opening your computer right back up - but always know when you have 'successfully hit your goal'.

## Code Resources

### [The 2017 Front-End Handbook](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/front-end-handbook-2017) by Frontend Masters

Dig in to some of the resources and review.

### [30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)

## Community and Professional Skills Resources

### Blog

Increase your value as a developer by writing blog posts. Avoid oversharing personal details, use good titles, use refactored code examples and format the post well. Imagine what blog post you had wish you had found when you were googling a problem.

Use a site like [medium.com](https://medium.com/) for hosting so that you have a higher chance of the post being found.

Review this [lesson](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/writing_a_blog_post_and_peer_review.md) for more ideas/best practices.

### Record Videos & Give Talks

If you want to give a conference talk someday, prove that you can do it with a screencast or a tutorial video. Make the videos small and be prepared to record them multiple times.

Upload slides on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/) so that you can share them easily.

Join the `#thought-leadership` channel in slack and get advice, lists of upcoming conferences, etc.

[Lanyard.com](http://lanyrd.com/calls/) has a pretty comprehensive list of calls for speakers.

### Leverage the Turing Community

Reach out early and often with Meg, Lia and the rest of the professional skills team.

Reach out to your instructors for advice.

Most importantly, use your cohort-mates and don't let your groups slack channel go silent.
