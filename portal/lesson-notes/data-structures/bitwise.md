When you are done reading, respond to this emoji poll

:clown: - I would prefer to work solo on the code challenges

:dance: - I would prefer to be pairing

If you chose pairing, snag someone who also chose the dancing emoji

Here are the rules.

This room will be the loud room - you can pair in here or work solo - but you're okay with talking, noises, music, etc.

The hallway is the talking area - pairing and talking only, no music

The staff room and the couches outside the door are the quiet work places. No talking in those rooms. If you want to talk, come out to the loud areas.
