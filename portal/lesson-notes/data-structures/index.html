Notes from Dale on ways to improve the Friday sessions:

> Thanks for the change-up on Friday. When I knew I could run to the quiet solo space, it gave me the resolve to stay in the loud room.  That said, the ‘loud room’ was crazy quiet! :smiley:

Maybe the Friday lesson could be followed by a discussion in an assigned group of 3 to 4 on an approach the problem.

Then the groups could make a choice to divide to an instructor led Loud group solving room, a pair/team led Mummer solving area with a floating instructor, and solo Quiet solving area?

This could create a little peer-pressure to collaborate while allowing for a safe retreat.

…just some though jazz that could use some refactoring.

Thanks for your incredibly dedicated work!
