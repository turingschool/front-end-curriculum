# Discussion

- Mod 2 is currently working on a React app using Ajax and hitting an API (and using React)
- Mod 4 is currently working on GameTime

## Discussion Part 1: Show and Tell

- Each person in the group: spend about 5 minutes showing/talking about the project that you are working on

## Discussion Part 2: Discuss the Issues

Designate someone as the note taker - as a group, bring up the following things:

- Without getting buried in the code specifically, talk about the main issues that you're stuck on in the project.
  - What is confusing about working with an API or building a game?
  - What is confusing about JavaScript?
  - What is confusing about Webpack?

## Discussion Part 3: Halp!

- Now that you have identified issues/confusing topics:
  - Identify and respond to any problems/topics you can help explain
  - Identify which problems/topics that the group as a whole is still confused about
  - Document your results if they can be helpful to instructors or fellow students!
