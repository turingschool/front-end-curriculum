## Getting Started

### Development Branch

A develpment server is running for the `development` branch of this project. You
can find that site [here](https://sage-cupcake-e1a0c3.netlify.app/).

### Prerequisites

In order to get this repo up and running you will need to have Ruby 2.7.4 installed and active. 

Install Homebrew if you don't already have it:  

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow prompts if necessary (you may need to enter your computer password, as well as run a few scripts prompted in the terminal output).

Install Ruby Version Manager:  

```shell
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```

Install Ruby version 2.7.4 using RVM:  

```shell
rvm install 2.7.4
```

You will also need the `bundler` and `jekyll` gems installed.

```shell
gem install bundler
gem install jekyll
```

### Installing

Once you have Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll installed, you can install dependencies by running:

```shell
bundle
```

And after all dependencies are installed, you can run the following to start your local server on port 4000:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

**DO NOT INDENT YOUR MARKDOWN** within the section tag, or else it will not work.


### Algolia Search

The site uses [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) for search indexing. To re-index the search when new lessons are added or lessons are removed, run this 
command in your terminal at the root of the curriculum directory:

```shell
ALGOLIA_API_KEY=admin_api_key bundle exec jekyll algolia push
```

Where `admin_api_key` is replaced with the actual admin API key found in the Algolia account dashboard.
