**Topic: Serving Over a Million Users in the 2016 Election**
TurboVote aims to be the most accurate tool for helping people register to vote, vote by mail, and received reminders about every election they can participate in. Under the covers the system migrated from a monolithic Rails app to distributed Clojure microservices, fronted by a ClojureScript/React single page browser based application. This talk is a case study in that migration including some plusses and pitfalls we found moving from a monolithic architecture to microservices.

### M2-M4 Gear Up (1:15 - 2:15)
We will discuss ["Microaggressions"](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions.markdown) at Blake and Gusto. Students will need to **self-select** into one of the following topics and show up at the corresponding location.

1. **Microaggressions 101 | GUSTO:** Learn what a microaggression is, look at examples, and discuss what they mean for individuals and community.
2. **Responding to Microaggressions | BLAKE:** What is within your sphere of control to reduce microaggressions in our community and address their consequences when they do occur?
3. **Lived Experiences | BLAKE:** For those who’ve felt the effect of microaggressions to discuss the experience and what it’s meant to them. Listening to others share is a valid form of participation for this topic.

Module 1 (BE/FE) will have their own Gear Up/Citizenship session at Guaranty Bank, S300.
